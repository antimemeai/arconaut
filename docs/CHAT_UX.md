# Chat ergonomics baseline

The [terminal redesign discussion plan](TUI_PLAN.md) adds the operator's explicit
2026-10-07 requirement: vivid colors, animation, visual quality and useful density
are first-pass work alongside inline slash discovery. Advanced controls follow
later. The delivered behaviors below remain the current implementation baseline.

The operator adopted this direction on2026-10-07: **chat-first, tools-secondary**, with a capable composer, discoverable commands and a readable conversation. This is the baseline, not ornamental polish. Powerful Lua/JSON/CLI paths remain available; ordinary interaction should not require memorizing them.

## Composer: delivered first editing slice

Enter sends. Alt-Enter or Ctrl-J inserts a newline. Bracketed paste stays literal and never submits itself, invokes a shortcut, or dispatches a command.

| Key | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Up / Down | Move between explicit newline-delimited draft lines, maintaining the desired terminal-cell column across short lines. On the first/last logical line, browse history. |
| Ctrl-P / Ctrl-N | Explicit older/newer history, even inside a multiline draft. Returning to the current draft restores its original cursor as well as its text. |
| Left / Right | Move between UTF-8 codepoint boundaries. Application-mode arrow sequences are also supported. |
| Home / End, Ctrl-A / Ctrl-E | Start/end of the current logical line. |
| Ctrl-Home / Ctrl-End | Start/end of the entire draft (when the terminal sends the corresponding modified-key sequences). |
| Alt-B / Alt-F, Ctrl-Left / Ctrl-Right | Move backward/forward through tokens separated by ASCII whitespace. Option-as-Meta/terminal key mapping may be needed for Alt shortcuts on macOS. |
| Ctrl-W, Alt-Backspace | Delete the preceding token. |
| Alt-D | Delete through the next token. |
| Ctrl-K | Kill to line end; at line end, kill the newline. |
| Ctrl-U | Clear the draft. |
| Ctrl-Y | Yank the last deletion/clear. This is one transient kill buffer, not a persistent kill ring or general undo. An oversized yank is rejected atomically. |
| Ctrl-C | Request stop and clear pending queue; preserve the current unsent draft. |
| Ctrl-Q | Stop and exit, persisting the current draft/cursor. |

Vertical motion uses the existing renderer's terminal-cell rules, including wide characters, combining marks, pasted tabs and escaped invalid bytes. This is codepoint editing, not full grapheme-cluster editing. Wrapped visual rows are not separate editing lines yet. History selection is a draft preview; it is never submitted merely by navigation.

## Command discovery: delivered

Tab completes a slash-command name at the end of the token. A unique argument-taking command adds a space; ambiguity expands only the common prefix. Completion never submits. The composer hint shows matching names or the selected command's syntax and purpose.

`/help`, `/keys`, `/queue` and `/cancel` are immediate local TUI controls, even while work is active. Other session/model/context commands keep their owning worker's turn-boundary semantics. `/clear` clears display only, not model context. `/queue` distinguishes pending prompts from recovered drafts, whose submission remains explicit.

## External editor: delivered

**Ctrl-G** opens the current draft in `$VISUAL`, falling back to `$EDITOR` and then `vi`. **`/edit`** opens a blank draft. This is idle-only: a busy turn refuses the handoff without changing the current draft. Set a foreground command that waits for editing to finish, e.g. `VISUAL='code --wait'` or `EDITOR='nvim'`. Editor command strings are trusted operator configuration, with the private temporary file appended as a shell-quoted argument.

The terminal returns to its ordinary screen/canonical mode for the editor and restores the TUI afterwards. A private 0600 temporary file starts with the draft. Only a successful editor exit and a regular, nonsymlink file of at most1MiB are imported; failures retain the original text/cursor. Unchanged text preserves cursor position; changed text returns with the cursor at its end. Typeahead is discarded on return. **Enter still sends explicitly.** The temporary file is removed afterwards. This does not govern shared editor daemons or claim all remote/editor effects have settled.

## Searchable palette: delivered

**Ctrl-Space** (NUL in ordinary terminals) or **Ctrl-T** opens the command palette without disturbing the draft. **`/commands`** also opens it locally. Type to filter names, descriptions and groups case-insensitively; exact and partial command-name matches rank ahead of description/group matches. **Up/Down**, **Ctrl-P/N** or **Tab** select a result. **Enter loads the command into the composer, not into the worker.** A second explicit Enter sends it. Commands with arguments load their name and a trailing space for you to fill in.

**Escape**, **Ctrl-C** or the opening shortcut backs out to the untouched draft and cursor. Ctrl-C is modal while the palette is open; close it before using Ctrl-C to stop the worker. Ctrl-Q still quits. Paste only filters; embedded control bytes do not execute commands. The palette is a local bounded viewport and remains available during busy work; selecting a command does not change model/workflow settings or queue a turn.

When selection replaces a nonempty draft, that draft is retained in **`/drafts`**; **`/draft N`** retrieves it without submitting. If draft storage is full, selection is refused and the original draft remains. The number of visible results adapts to the window; expand very short windows to see more entries. Lone Escape is resolved on the input polling idle interval, distinguishing it from arrow/meta sequences.

## Next separate UX slices

1. Wrapped visual-row navigation and a more generous adaptive composer viewport.
2. Human-friendly session/model pickers beyond the general command palette.
3. Distinct conversation blocks, bounded collapsible tool output, unobtrusive truthful activity, search, unread/follow-tail controls.

Keep useful expert paths and truthful work ownership. A polished display must not pretend a stored steer was consumed, a stopped request settled remote effects, a tool completion accepted a unit, or a source commit activated a running executable.
