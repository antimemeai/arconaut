# Arconaut journal

## 2026-09-29 — Clone and reopen the foundations

Read the workspace Blackbird doctrine. The operator requested a clone and critical
assessment before restarting the personal coding harness: revisit research,
design, and planning, then decide which implementation belongs in the restart.

Cloned `https://github.com/antimemeai/arconaut.git` into `~/projects/arconaut`.
The public `master` ends at `76ddf00`. Read the existing local checkout at
`~/projects_old/miscellaneous/arconaut`: no configured remotes, one untracked
`lemonnotes.md`, and 15 additional commits ending at `3bf2056`. Fetched that
history into `refs/remotes/legacy-local/master` and created local branch
`assessment/2026-09-29` from it. The ZIP's recorded master is also `3bf2056`;
its 211,400 entries include reference material and filesystem detritus.
The original checkout and ZIP remain untouched.

Copied Blackbird verbatim. Archived inherited instruction files, beads records,
and CI configuration under `docs/history/`, preserving Git history. Copied the
untracked design note into that history. The fresh entry points explicitly make
the inherited plans and code subjects of assessment. Disabled local Git hooks for
this assessment. No product code has been changed or run at this point.

Assessment sub-plan: establish lineage; independently examine architecture,
behavior/test oracles, and research/design claims; synthesize a current baseline
with explicit retention decisions and unresolved operator choices; adversarially
review the synthesis; record the next research/design work in fresh issue tracking.
Do not treat passing inherited tests as acceptance of an inherited specification.

## 2026-09-29–30 — Complete the assessment baseline

Blackbird's independent conceptual reviews produced architecture, oracle, and
research assessments in `papers/`. The architecture review traced the actual CLI
through the older Soul, found provider URL and tool-conversation losses, the TUI
terminal wait cycle, stale per-turn tool caching, and disconnected session/mode/
auth surfaces. Pilot/reactor contains useful runtime experiments but its turn and
continuation paths remain unimplemented. No product repairs were made.

The oracle reviewer inspected tests before selecting credential-free execution.
The locked full-workspace all-target/all-feature check passed on Rust 1.89.0;
70 selected core, audit, and provider tests passed. A direct probe against the
unchanged code found zero token accounting for tool-result text, inconsistent
history/token state after clear/revert, and a compaction fixture that never
compacts. The probe is preserved in `papers/experiments/`; bounded execution logs
remain in ignored `context/oracle-assessment/`. These checks do not establish
whole-harness conformance, declared Rust 1.85 compatibility, or Linux CI behavior.

The research reviewer checked consequential claims against primary sources and
selected captured implementations. Real structured-editing and compression
studies support narrower conclusions than the June plans claim. Hosted prompt
caching contradicts the pre-design's restriction to self-hosting; OpenCode has
concrete repeated-tool detection; the proposed LanceDB/USearch composition lacks
an established integration contract. Recovered the three missing June literature
reports from `projects_old/neurotic_library/outposts/` into `papers/history/`,
unchanged and labeled historical. They expose further drift between the source
syntheses and the pre-design. Unchecked numerical claims remain hypotheses.

Cataloged all 53 legacy reference directories and their available origins/HEADs.
Created an intact source-history bundle under the shared archive shelf and clean
Git-archive snapshots of Brush, mini-swe-agent, and OpenCode. Imported 669, 220,
and 5,663 regular files respectively, stripping nested Git and filesystem detritus
and explicitly omitting symbolic links. Compared every retained file directly
with its source ZIP. Sources and restoration commands are in `QUARANTINE.md` and
the shared manifest. Original checkouts and the large Arconaut ZIP remain intact.
Verified the doctrine copy, required ignores, and absence of a workspace `.git`.

Wrote `docs/RESTART.md`: assessed facts, candidate reuse, prototype preservation,
retired historical authority, proposed invariants, and research/design sequencing.
An independent adversarial review raised four valid findings: uncertain external
effect outcomes, conceptual study decomposition, replay versus intervention
benefit, and an ambiguous historical-status label. Integrated all four; their
dispositions are recorded in `papers/2026-09-29-baseline-review.md`.

Fresh beads issues preserve the next work: `arconaut-ahb` for the operator workflow
and behavioral contract, `arconaut-8n8` for research and reviewed integrated design,
and `arconaut-w8q` for component disposition and reviewed implementation planning.
They form a dependency sequence; they do not resurrect the June backlog.
The operator's repeated “proceed” instructions authorized continued assessment;
the particular first workflow remains a provisional design choice.

Beads initialization had automatically committed staged setup and injected a
generic agent-instruction block; removed that block from the current instructions
and disabled automatic backup/push. Its one automatic push attempt had failed for
lack of a branch upstream. On resumption, the server's current data directory did
not contain Arconaut because initialization had reused Rhizome's server. Located
the intact `arconaut` database under `rhizome/.beads/dolt/`, stopped Arconaut's
new local server, copied that database into its own `.beads/dolt/` without changing
the original, and restarted. All four issue records and dependencies recovered.
Exported final issue state into `.beads/issues.jsonl` for repository restoration.
The installed bd 0.58.0 flags its own fresh export as newer than its last-import
timestamp. Read the known current database with `bd --allow-stale ready --json`
after this deliberate export; it returns the workflow decision as ready. Its
export help mentions an `import` command that this installed version lacks. No
database reinitialization or speculative metadata edits were made.

The assessment artifacts are local working changes on `assessment/2026-09-29`.
Product source and Cargo manifests/lockfile still match `3bf2056`. This completes
the source assessment and refreshed baseline; the subsequent product design and
implementation plan remain explicit future work.
Final checks found all current document links resolving, four exported issues
including the closed assessment, no whitespace errors, and no product-source
or Cargo changes against the assessed source.

## 2026-09-30 — Operator recollection and implementation provenance

The operator was surprised to find tool execution and provider implementations,
remembering work on time and foundation pieces. Treat this as a significant
provenance question, not as confirmation that the larger inherited implementation
was intended or approved. The reviewed code's existence establishes only that
it is present in the recovered source.

Traced introductions in the preserved Git history: `134aff2` adds core/context
foundation at 05:15 EDT on June 7; `501e17a` adds Anthropic/REPL at 05:17;
`6c12d73` adds built-in tools at 05:51; `397dcc3` adds the execution loop at 06:00;
`24ec457` adds the wider provider layer at 11:17. These are recorded commit dates,
not independent evidence of elapsed work or operator approval. The commits use
the configured Patrick Beam identity; that alone cannot identify who directed
or accepted the work. Revisit the intended foundation boundary before giving
any of these higher-layer implementations design authority.

## 2026-09-30 — Reconstruct from a quarantined source

The operator explicitly requested moving the current implementation into
`quarantine/arconaut/` and reconstructing the project in the manner of the fresh
Rhizome repository next door. Read Rhizome's current scaffold and restoration
practices without changing its files.

Migration sub-plan: preserve a ZIP of the assessed `3bf2056` source plus the
previously untracked `lemonnotes.md`; move the implementation, Cargo/build/lint
configuration, June design/research documents, historical instructions, old issue
records, and CI into the ignored reference tree. Restore their original source
layout. Retain current doctrine, assessment reports, literature, journal, issue
tracking, reference snapshots, and reconstruction notes at the project root.
Update links and source-path conventions so the assessment remains usable.
Compare the retained reference files directly with the preserved ZIP and check
that no legacy workspace or automation remains active at the root.

Also adopt Rhizome's supported beads backup workflow and a dedicated local server
port. Preserve the existing issue database and legacy export; replace instructions
that caused repeated stale-import warnings. Reconstruction starts with time and
foundation design, with higher-layer reuse subject to the reviewed new design.

Completed the migration. The new immutable
`quarantine_proj/archives/arconaut-3bf2056-source.zip` contains the 181 tracked
source files plus the unchanged note. Every one of the 182 quarantined files
matches its archived bytes and executable bits; the file set has no additions
or omissions. No nested Git metadata or filesystem detritus remains. The source
ZIP, original large archive, original checkout, and complete history bundle remain
intact. Restoration and archive identity are recorded in both manifests.

The active root has no inherited Cargo workspace, crates, or CI. Current entry
points now lead to `docs/FOUNDATION.md`; all old instructions, phases, and backlog
are explicitly historical. Retained assessments use the new source locations.
No legacy implementation was selected and no product code was patched. An
independent authority/scope review found no material blocker. Accepted and
resolved both navigation findings; its report and dispositions are in
`papers/2026-09-30-reconstruction-review.md`.

Preserved the earlier issue export in ignored context, retained all current issues
and dependencies, and changed the dedicated Dolt port to `13308`. Normal beads
reads now work without the stale-import override. The repository uses supported
`bd backup` snapshots; automatic backups and pushes remain disabled. Rhizome's
files and database were not changed. Updated the remaining issue sequence to
recover the intended time/foundation design, review the broader design, then
review component disposition and the implementation plan. This migration and
scaffold are local uncommitted changes; source history has not been rewritten.

Closed `arconaut-18i` and saved the final supported backup: five issues (two
closed, three open) and six dependencies. Final checks found current document
entry points resolving, quarantine/context ignored, doctrine identical, no
workspace Git repository, and no whitespace errors. The next ready issue is
`arconaut-ahb`, recovering the intended time and foundation design.

## 2026-09-30 — Expert operator intent

The operator clarified the product purpose: a coding agent built from the
beginning for an advanced, technically sophisticated operator who mixes paradigms,
experiments with unusual arrangements such as multi-model IRC-style live
collaboration, integrates ordinary computing tools and programs, and has almost
zero interest in approving commands or fretting over tool calls.

Documentation sub-plan: preserve this statement in the current foundation brief,
distinguish explicit intent from proposed architectural implications, and reconcile
entry points, research directions, and remaining issues. The remembered time work
remains relevant to provenance and foundation research; it must not narrow the
product ambition or prevent studying collaboration from the beginning.

Updated README, AGENTS, FOUNDATION, and RESTART accordingly. Proposed implications
cover composition, live concurrent participation, computing integration, and
standing authority with useful visibility and steering. No transport, model
vendor, plugin architecture, storage engine, interface, or execution scheme has
been selected. The preference for autonomous Arconaut operation does not itself
request unrelated external actions in this working session. The quarantined
source remains unchanged. Subsequent research/design must develop concrete
scenarios and challenge these interpretations before implementation planning.

## 2026-09-30 — Fresh frumentarii and self-improvement requirements

The operator explicitly requested fresh frumentarii, citing Claude Science's
standing database and Prime Agent's Python kernel as examples, and emphasizing
expressive workflows available to both human and model. Further requirements:
model ergonomics; hot configurable turn redefinition; compaction as a managed
event with options; a comprehensive core audit log for study/improvement; hot
reload wherever physically possible; and autodroit collaboration on autoresearch-
style improvements in situ. A strong systems foundation matters; OpenTUI
convenience and JS event-loop assumptions must not determine the core.

Rust is optional. JS/TS and Go face strong operator distrust and JVM approaches
are generally forbidden. Compiled languages remain attractive if a model can
maintain continuity, rebuild the harness, and inhabit the new version. Otherwise
minimizing the compiled component is the operator's provisional preference.
Self-improvement is a core product principle.

Research/acquisition sub-plan: dispatch independent conceptual reconnaissance
for standing/queryable agent state, programmable workflows/persistent execution,
and strong runtime/continuity mechanisms; synthesize with a separate study of
autoresearch/evaluation mechanisms. Read current primary sources and inspect
exact source revisions. Distinguish implemented mechanisms from advertised claims
and our inferences. Preserve intermediate reports in papers, acquire selected
intact source ZIPs and papers, import clean ignored references with provenance
and restoration commands, then write a comparative synthesis and unresolved
design questions. No product implementation or language selection in this pass.

Reused the three independent assessment colleagues as frumentarii, explicitly
authorized by the operator, and sent each later clarification. Their temporary
source material has separate ignored context directories. Updated the current
brief and entry points to preserve every stated requirement and distinguish them
from proposed implementations. Historical time work remains evidence rather
than a gate blocking study of the new ambition.

Completed three independent reports plus the parent autodroit study and comparative
synthesis. Acquired sixteen exact-commit source ZIPs, preserving the archives under
the shared shelf. Imported 33,036 regular files into clean ignored references;
compared every retained byte and executable bit directly with its ZIP and checked
the exact file sets. Symbolic links remain in archives and are explicitly omitted
from extraction. Both manifests and the source catalog record full revisions,
archive hashes, omission lists, and restoration. Acquired seven versioned PDFs
with identities and ignored local paths in the literature catalog. Reports bound
reading and source-inspection scope; no imported product, installer, test, benchmark,
live provider, or mutation run was executed.

The source research found fresh mechanisms and consequential limits: native Prime
now wraps a CPython REPL, with partial snapshots, live-variable pruning, owner-bound
kernel lifetime and a limited reload handler; busy-target messaging in some agent
systems falls short of live peers; compiled Lisp and OTP offer live-change options
with different state/resource boundaries. Queryable state and context histories
do not themselves supply comprehensive audit. No language, runtime, database, or
reference architecture was selected.

Independent synthesis review raised R1: full captured originals must remain separate
from reduced active context and derived audit views. Accepted it and corrected
FOUNDATION plus the compaction/audit scenarios. Known emitted inputs/outputs supply
the direct completeness oracle; surviving-log consistency or a deletion marker
cannot recover discarded evidence. The review records its scope and resolution.

The operator requested an occasional eye on Rhizome's possible C++ choice and rigor
research. Read its current `papers/cpp-rigor-stack.md` feasibility proposal. It
leaves the language/stack undecided; contract-first ownership and representation,
fault-specific evidence, operational toolchain trials, and semantic/recovery oracles
are useful transferable leads. Added read-only research checkpoints to the brief
and instructions; no scheduled automation, Rhizome mutation, or import of Rhizome's
product/publishing rules. The compiled/dynamic boundary remains an Arconaut research
question governed by continuity and self-improvement.

Updated remaining brief/design/planning issues, closed reconnaissance issue
`arconaut-we8`, and saved a supported beads backup. It retains six issues (three
closed, three open) and seven dependencies. Final checks found fourteen current
document entry points resolving, complete source/literature catalogs, references
and PDFs ignored, unchanged doctrine, no active Cargo workspace or parent Git
repository, and no whitespace errors. All work remains local and uncommitted.
The source corpus comparison was performed once directly; subsequent checks
covered navigation/catalog completeness, not another preservation receipt layer.

## 2026-09-30 — Outpost refit discussion and operational boundary

The operator proposed a concrete autodroit sequence: context is local data; an
outpost process obtains provider access; the provisional powerword `arcorefit`
repoints context and operator focus to outpost chat, tells the model that refit
is happening, and exposes the compilation output for observation. A new window
is a possibility, not a selected interface.

The operator then supplied the operational rules: the main harness has no active
programs or provider requests at refit time. Standing work is paused and preserved,
not terminated. If that pause is unacceptable, the operator should deploy the
relevant work as independent OS daemons. Paused resident work and external daemons
therefore need different treatment from actively executing harness work.

Documentation sub-plan: record the explicit rules separately from the provisional
outpost mechanism; revise the earlier rebuild scenario to quiesce/pause before
refit; preserve open questions about handoff/return, actual paused-program lifetime,
build failures, and audit continuity without imposing a suspension/IPC/storage/UI
choice. Updated FOUNDATION and the current synthesis accordingly. The original
source reports remain dated evidence; their implementation findings are unchanged.
No refit command, program, provider request, compile, or product implementation
was run. This is design discussion, not a claim that the mechanism is implemented.

The operator then generalized the outpost: pack full context or a subset for a
remote server, let the model work directly in that environment, and communicate
with the main-chat colleague. Recorded this as a general working-environment/peer
inquiry, keeping the arcorefit conversation handoff distinct from concurrent
remote participants. Context selection, later updates, host/workspace attribution,
message delivery/consumption, and independent lifetime remain design questions.
Updated the current live-room scenario and entry points. No remote connection or
deployment was performed, and no transport or agent topology was selected.

Updated the brief and integrated-design issue notes with these scenarios and
preserved the issue state using `bd backup`. Documentation whitespace checks
passed; the outpost entry point resolves to the current foundation discussion.

## 2026-09-30 — Return to the integrated design

The operator supplied two more outpost examples: local provider-specific capability
access (a Gemini key for Google search) and useful outposts without an active model.
Recorded these as design examples, without claiming a verified Gemini integration.
They explicitly asked us to move on rather than expand the outpost inquiry.

Written documentation/research sub-plan: develop the expert behavioral brief from
the stated intent and assembled corpus; study the runtime/replacement boundary,
complete audit/standing state, and executable workflow semantics as separate coherent
conceptual units; integrate those studies into a concrete candidate design; then
adversarially review the brief/design before implementation planning. Reused the
three existing colleagues under Blackbird's research/review delegation practice.
Their studies belong in papers; source references remain historical/quarantined.

Wrote docs/BEHAVIOR.md with ordinary coding plus six discriminating scenarios.
It makes identities/time, live messaging, hot applicability boundaries, compaction,
quiescent refit with paused preserved programs, audit fault behavior, and autodroit
outcomes explicit. It is proposed behavior, not implemented capability or a selected
language. No product code or remote operation was introduced.

The three studies converged on independent resource/recording ownership and exact
change boundaries. Runtime study recommends live compiled SBCL control with a narrow
Rust owner; workflow study initially preferred Python and then distinguished the
main controller from an optional model-facing workflow binding/host. No comparative
Lisp/Python model result is claimed. Audit study proposes transactional originals
and operational state, durable-before-dispatch/publication, explicit crash uncertainty,
and degraded emergency control rather than silent unrecorded continuation.

Integrated docs/DESIGN.md as a concrete candidate: responsibilities/physical lifetimes,
identities/time, shared operations, hot executable turns, rooms, context/compaction,
complete observed audit and fault handling, quiescent refit, and autodroit. It names
SBCL/Rust/Python/SQLite as provisional choices with six bounded feasibility questions,
not adopted shipping code. Read local executable availability: Python/Cargo/Clang are
present, SBCL is not on PATH. No installation or feasibility run was performed.
The resource owner's own crash/replacement and arbitrary descendant pause remain
explicit limits; no unsupported full-harness preservation claim was made.

Three independent cross-reviews found nine valid integration defects. Corrected
owner-epoch dispatch and return quiescence, main refit cohort/gate reopening, query
result retention and finite watches (including mutual watch recursion), authoritative
state versus lagging views, independent provider transport controls, late tool protocol
continuations after compaction, durable decision/action recovery, migration side-effect
overclaims, and live compiled policy versus native refit wording. Reviewers reread
their fixes and recorded resolution. These are discussion-contract corrections;
no corresponding runtime behavior has been verified. Dispositions are recorded in
papers/2026-09-30-brief-review.md and the three independent review reports.

The operator clarified their preferred sequence: take the brief as far as useful,
review/discuss together, then start specification in pen from the ground up. This
supersedes the earlier direction toward treating this candidate as the next design
artifact. Moved docs/DESIGN.md to papers/2026-09-30-foundation-design-discussion.md,
keeping the proposal and review history but making its research/discussion authority
explicit. Updated working brief, entry points, current agent instructions, and
review navigation. Added a concise discussion agenda. Runtime/storage choices remain
open; there is no adopted specification, implementation plan, or product code.

Current-document check: 126 local links in 22 documents resolve. Preserved the
clarified phase and remaining operator discussion in brief/specification issue
notes; the brief decision remains in progress until that discussion, and the later
specification task remains open. No future plan was prematurely marked complete.

Reread the independent reports. Corrected one SLY backend citation path against the
pinned local source tree. Saved the final issue backup with `bd backup`; documentation
whitespace checks pass. Work remains local and uncommitted.

## 2026-09-30 — Brief discussion: model agency and early self-development

Discussed the first agenda item: a programmable working environment, useful default
coding behavior, model access to the programs governing its own work, and everyday
programmability versus autodroit's experimental role. The operator agreed with the
premise and clarified three requirements: first milestone is building Arconaut in
Arconaut ASAP; substantial model agency includes configuring and modifying the
working programs in normal operation; autodroit is tunable from a couple of manual
interventions to full model-governed autoresearch with operator steering.

Documentation sub-plan: record these as explicit operator intent in FOUNDATION,
integrate the milestone and agency into the working brief/autodroit scenario, and
update the entry point and issue notes. Keep the proposed milestone completion loop
separate from its as-yet-undiscussed exact scope. Continue the discussion with
lifetime/resource continuity; do not select languages or start specification/planning
ahead of the agreed discussion phase.

Milestone wording is separate from the broader purpose/scenarios, so the full
composition ambition is not accidentally declared a prerequisite for first use.
Saved updated issue state with `bd backup`; documentation whitespace checks pass.

## 2026-09-30 — Brief discussion: consumer of a shared computational fabric

The operator corrected the proposed lifetime/ownership boundary: kernels, databases,
and similar computation are not resident Arconaut-owned work. They may serve an army
of Arconauts. Arconaut is the consumer/customer, not their governor. A later
meta-project fabric will provide control-plane/scaling and shared governance.
Otherwise they agreed with the direction discussed.

Documentation sub-plan: record the explicit ownership correction in FOUNDATION;
update working brief, refit scope, entry points, and current agent instructions;
mark the ownership-heavy research candidate as superseded in that respect while
preserving original studies/reviews as dated evidence; carry the scope into issue
notes. Refit quiesces the consumer's own execution/client activity and pauses its
own standing programs if present. It does not pause shared services or other
consumers. Reconnection recovers access under service contracts; it is not custody
of an external heap or proof that other consumers made no changes.

The early self-development milestone can consume existing services without first
building their governor/control plane. No runtime or new architecture was selected,
no external service was contacted, and no fabric implementation was begun.

Updated brief/design/plan issue notes and saved their backup. Current discussion
candidate, three focused studies, synthesis and review record now carry the scope
correction without rewriting their observed source evidence. Documentation whitespace
checks pass; no implementation, source archives, or quarantined code changed.

## 2026-09-30 — Brief discussion: deferred activation and interrupt/apply

The operator replaced the proposed next-decision default: changes should take effect
after the current turn or workflows underway conclude. They want a combined
interrupt-and-do-it-now action, analogous to submitting queued prompts immediately
with Control+Enter or a similar gesture. The gesture is an example, not a selected
shortcut or UI design.

Documentation sub-plan: record the explicit default and override in FOUNDATION;
replace next-decision wording and its direct scenario in the working brief; add
the rule to current instructions and mark earlier candidate/workflow proposal
defaults as superseded. Current work keeps its definitions through conclusion;
pending/interrupting/applied should be legible. Exact transition and overlapping-
workflow scope remain specification questions. This preserves substantial ordinary
model agency and creates no approval gate. Interrupting one consumer does not
pause the shared fabric. No implementation or frontend design was started.

Updated the brief/specification/plan issue notes and saved the issue backup with
`bd backup`. Documentation whitespace checks pass.

## 2026-09-30 — Brief discussion: audit as recovery source and research corpus

The operator added that original audit material lets the model repair overzealously
compacted or otherwise corrupted working context, and forms a fascinating dataset
over time. Documentation sub-plan: record those explicit purposes in FOUNDATION;
make model-usable original retrieval, compaction lineage and recorded repair part
of the audit/compaction brief; add a direct continued-task scenario with a known
omitted/misstated requirement. Preserve defective contexts and repairs as evidence,
and separate source observations from derived indexes/annotations/datasets.
No retrieval/storage architecture or implementation was selected.

Updated brief/specification issue notes and saved `bd backup`; documentation
whitespace checks pass.

## 2026-09-30 — Brief discussion: model rageshake

The operator agreed with the model-ergonomics direction and requested model rageshake
available everywhere: report frustration/bugs/problems with details, basically open
a bead. Their trailing clause was garbled; asked a concise asynchronous clarification
while reading the current brief. They clarified before any requirement was written:
the bead captures agent state in various ways, and the complaint is also tracked
in a separate database table elsewhere. The reporting model has no obligation to
fix it in that moment; follow-up repair is expected at the first suitable opportunity.

Documentation sub-plan: preserve explicit intent in FOUNDATION, add the complaint
operation/state capture/tracking/follow-up to model ergonomics and an ordinary-work
scenario, and record it in the brief/specification issues. Automatic state capture
and retained evidence avoid forcing manual report construction. One complaint identity
links the actionable bead, separate tracking row and original evidence; these have
distinct purposes, not extra audit receipts. Capture uses observed agent/service
state and does not pause/govern shared computational services. Name, detailed state
capture, delivery/failure semantics and repair scheduling remain specification work.
No actual bug complaint, bead implementation or external database write was made.

Updated brief/specification issue notes and saved `bd backup`; documentation
whitespace checks pass.

## 2026-09-30 — Milestone agreed; enlarge the agent corpus

The operator agreed to the self-development milestone completion scenario: actual
Arconaut development through its own conversation and programs; deferred/interrupt
activation of governing-program changes; compiled outpost refit with continuity and
failed-build recovery; retained original audit, context repair, and captured-state
rageshake with tracked follow-up. Recorded this agreement in FOUNDATION and BEHAVIOR.
Execution-model discussion remains open; implementation choices remain undecided.
Carried the workspace owned-machinery/library-adoption rule into project instructions.

The operator requested all known missing agents plus a frumentarius to discover and
bring home additional agents. Acquisition sub-plan: reconcile the 53-entry original
catalog, 19 active external snapshots, and source-only leads from the fresh research;
bring known missing agent references into active quarantine at exact upstream revisions
(honestly labeled historical fallback if necessary); independently discover novel
implementations. Preserve intact source ZIPs, strip nested Git/filesystem detritus from
extractions, compare retained file sets/bytes/executable bits directly to archives,
and integrate source/restoration manifests and unavailable-source notes. Reuse a
stdlib utility for repeat acquisition. Keep original project checkouts and existing
snapshots unchanged; run no imported automation. Known acquisition and novel discovery
are disjoint delegated conceptual units. Acquisition does not adopt dependencies or
select implementation architecture.

The operator additionally requested Claude Science and similar scientific systems.
Added a separate acquisition lane for official documentation, public examples and
freely downloadable distributions where available, preserving exact original bytes
and distinguishing source, binary/artifact, and documentation-only evidence. Novel
public scientific agents are covered by discovery. No installer or product will run;
credential/account/availability gaps are recorded for operator acquisition.

## 2026-09-30 — Agent corpus acquisition complete

Completed the requested known-agent pass and independent discovery: 36 known
references, 46 newly discovered references, complete K-Dense BYOK source/public
material, Claude Science's official public reference bundle, and official Claude
Code distributions. This adds 85 reference directories containing 247,196 retained
files; the shelf now has 104 external reference directories plus historical Arconaut.
Catalogs distinguish agents from supporting runtimes, collaboration machinery,
produced review material, public indexes, and distributions. Every selected unique
source is acquired; no source/distribution download remains unresolved.

Known acquisition includes 34 current upstream ZIPs, deliberately historical Letta
V1 source, and the honestly unversioned local Claudex pattern. Current Letta's public
landing repository and historical V1 share an origin intentionally; this is dated
source coverage, not two independent agents. Discovery corrected four renamed aliases
and deduplicated AgentRxiv against the author-linked AgentLaboratory, retaining the
failed speculative lead and correction. Kaagum's temporary bare clone was removed
after a pinned source export. Source exports leave declared submodules and Git LFS
pointers unresolved; reports record those limits rather than claiming runnable builds.

Claude Science acquisition includes four official 0.1.55 distributions, all 29 indexed
Science documents, seven public examples, installers and release metadata. Its author's
computational-review template and actual VIP outputs are separately acquired; their
per-section JSON evidence workflow does not expose the app's internal database/kernel.
K-Dense BYOK includes complete pinned source, 27 repository documents and 326 workflow
templates. Official Claude Code 2.1.286 macOS ARM64/Linux x64 native programs and public
installer/release/npm-launcher material are preserved independently of the official
public repository and unverified unofficial source mirror. Vendor checksum comparisons
support distribution integrity; retained signatures were not independently verified.

The owned stdlib acquisition utility stages ingestion and directly compares retained
sets, bytes and executable bits with intact ZIPs before publication. An observed
relative-output bug in historical Git fallback was reproduced with a direct local
repository oracle and fixed using an absolute output path; all five small oracles pass.
Independently read the helper's path/URL bounds, staging, comparison and failure cleanup.
No additional unresolved code finding remains. Added Python cache ignores for its
local checks. No acquired program, installer, binary, wrapper or automation ran; no
dependency was adopted, model-provider credentials used, or product session started.

Integrated project/shared manifests, research indexes, exact restoration commands and
conditional shopping needs. Normalized the tracked Science/K-Dense catalog archive
paths to be relative to the Arconaut repository, matching their restore commands;
preserved archives and embedded originals remain unchanged. Direct inventory checks
find all 85 new archive/destination pairs and exactly the reported 247,196 files;
the extracted shelf has no nested Git/filesystem detritus or leftover acquisition
stages. Documentation link and whitespace checks pass. Closed the acquisition task,
recorded the corpus in ongoing brief/specification issues, and saved `bd backup`.
Execution-model discussion and specification remain subsequent work; no architecture,
implementation plan, language, reference module, or library has been adopted.

## 2026-09-30 — Extensive action/capabilities study

The operator requests extensive study of the acquired corpus and an action/capabilities
matrix covering all references. Research sub-plan: use the exact 104-reference shelf
plus historical Arconaut; define native action inventories and 23 capability axes;
study coherent reference families in parallel, completing each reference's source/docs/
test inspection and evidence-backed row before moving on; distinguish implemented,
documented, limited, supplied-primitive, unknown and inapplicable behavior. Trace the
ordinary loop, dispatch/results/state and feature lifecycles, not README checkboxes.
Inspect source/test oracles without running downloaded programs or installing anything.

Maintain exact paths/line evidence and explicit scope, then generate readable matrix,
dossiers, CSV and JSON from the single row dataset. Independently pressure-test high-risk
claims and coverage, resolve findings, and integrate source comparisons into the brief's
next discussion. Registry and methodology are in papers/capabilities/. Research and
renderer utilities are owned; no dependency adoption or product implementation starts.

2026-10-01 — Matrix rendering sub-plan: keep the authored rows as the single evidence
corpus. Build a small standard-library renderer that rejects missing references,
unknown axes/statuses, dangling evidence and impossible local source ranges, then
produces linked Markdown dossiers/action inventories and CSV/JSON views. These checks
attack inventory/link corruption; they do not validate the capability claims. Source
review must challenge those independently. Draft output must say incomplete, while
normal rendering requires every registered reference.

2026-10-01 — Completed root source studies for nine systems primitives, five
experiment libraries/programs, historical Arconaut, three Claude public/artifact
boundaries, seven persistent agents/gateways, and Aider/GPTMe/original Python Open
Interpreter. The Python interpreter and mutable-hook paths expose substantial
ordinary agency, while process-global namespace/capture and early cancellation
acknowledgements require explicit scope. GPTMe's separate main/view files support
message repair; recovery checkpoints and buffered steps do not provide original
audit completeness. Aider's all-summary-model failure publication and Open
Interpreter shell no-op stop are source-inferred failure cases, not new execution.

Redistributed the untouched Open SWE/OpenHands hosted/controller subgroup to root
and mail/terminal/station coordination services to the scientific/framework agent,
keeping conceptual groups intact. Current OpenHands is Agent Canvas consuming
separately distributed servers; Open SWE wires a delegated graph runtime and owns
application middleware/sandbox/transcript services. Preserve both actual snapshot
roles rather than attributing old implementations to current names.

Primary independent cross-family review corrected Letta landing-page feature
overclaims to role-inapplicable and OpenAI4S's optional SQL row limit. It separately
checked VTCode child ownership, Dagger continuations/reseed/return clipping,
Docker ingestion/compaction scope, Oh My Pi complaint acknowledgement, Prime
busy-target admission, Claude Science contracts and Bub anchor projection. Findings
and exact boundaries are in papers/capabilities/reviews/cross-family-claims-review.md.

Independent renderer review produced concrete corruption fixtures: malformed list
items survive validation and partially replace output, reordered axes mislabel
columns, group representations disagree, custom-depth/space-bearing source links
break and draft output leaves stale dossiers. Remediation sub-plan: type-check the
complete authored contract, bind labels to axis identities, validate one group
membership, construct all output bytes before publishing, compute escaped local
links from actual root/dossier paths, and remove only renderer-owned stale dossiers.
Add direct fixture oracles for those observed failures, rerun the owned suite and
request focused independent post-fix review. No reference programs/tests run and
no dependency is adopted.

Read Rhizome's C++ rigor and type/refactoring proposal at this checkpoint. Language
choice remains open. Transferable questions are ownership/publication/invalidation,
domain-separated identities and independent fault witnesses; tools and flag lists
do not establish those contracts. Research watch remains read-only. Current
capability synthesis is discussion input and does not adopt language/storage or
authorize product implementation.

2026-10-01 — Full corpus first render completed: 105 references, 2,415 capability
cells, 882 operation families and 2,595 evidence ranges. The independent renderer
recheck confirms the five original faults are corrected, then finds case-distinct
evidence IDs can resolve to the same heading. Citation remediation sub-plan:
derive citation anchors from the actual normalized evidence heading, reject
colliding normalized identities before rendering, and add direct collision and
punctuation-link fixtures. Recheck this fault independently before final publication.

2026-10-01 — Working survey complete for discussion: all 105 registered references
have dossiers and 23 axes (2,415 cells), with 882 native operation families, 2,595
source evidence ranges and 253 read-only test/check records. Fourteen family studies
and the synthesis compare actual mechanisms and ownership, including Claude Science's
opaque documented boundary, current OpenHands' external engines and Rust Orchestrator's
real but insufficiently quiescent self-build/exec path. No acquired code/tests ran,
no dependencies were adopted and no product implementation or architecture selected.

Selected independent semantic reviews corrected landing-page role overclaims,
optional SQL row-limit wording and IronClaw's per-wrapper versus pair-wide atomicity;
the OpenClaw remote skill-read claim gained its precise implementation anchor.
Independent renderer review and focused rechecks resolved all six reported faults.
The owned 14-test direct artifact suite passes; full strict corpus validation and
rendering pass. Generated views contain all 105 rows and dossiers; the local link
pass identified a corrected OTP filename and the then-pending persistent review,
which is now saved. Research indexes point to the matrix, operations and synthesis.

The operator reminds us this is discussion material, not exhibition work. Stop
expanding presentation/checking and return to the design conversation. The research
task is complete; remaining decisions belong to the brief/spec discussion and first
milestone of building Arconaut in Arconaut.

2026-10-01 — Operator requests Luna/Terra to make a useful local survey page while
the main discussion plots the self-development milestone. Delegated presentation
to Luna; it delivered papers/capabilities/index.html and an owned stdlib generator,
embedding all 105 references/23 axes without external assets or dependencies.
Luna checked dataset counts, dossier presence and JavaScript syntax; no rendered
browser verification was available. The page is a research viewer, not a harness
language/runtime choice. Main conversation agrees on a core/process versus editable
governing-program distinction and now discusses stack candidates; no adoption yet.

2026-10-01 — Operator excludes Python from production. The proposed Rust/Python
production stack is rejected; recorded the constraint in FOUNDATION, BEHAVIOR and
README. Lisp/SBCL and native-core alternatives remain discussion candidates, not
adopted implementations. Existing Python research utilities are not a production
stack choice. Discussion turns to Lisp syntax and its live native compilation.

2026-10-01 — Operator proposes C++ core, Lua governing scripts and hot-loadable
plugins, with core replacement using outpost refit. This is now a leading discussion
candidate, not a selected implementation/dependency set. Consulted official Lua
5.5 embedding/module documentation and Linux/macOS dynamic-loader documentation.
Relevant design boundaries: Lua owns substantive turn/workflow policy; active work
retains its definition/plugin generation; native plugins require explicit ABI and
ownership across calls/callbacks/threads/objects before retirement. Loader success
alone does not establish settlement or actual unload. Core changes follow the same
refit protocol under manual operation or autodroit; autodroit is not an access gate.

2026-10-01 — Operator asks about Erlang plugins. Consulted official OTP native
integration, code-loading and release-handling documentation. Discussion candidate:
separate BEAM-process plugins over an explicit operation/message interface, alongside
native C++ plugins and Lua governing programs. Erlang actors/supervision/code upgrade
are useful for coordination/workflows, but code reload still needs state migration
and chosen activation boundaries. Neither process restart nor message acknowledgement
establishes external-effect settlement. A separately governed shared node remains a
consumed service; plugin runtime choice does not transfer fabric governance to Arconaut.
No runtime/library or protocol implementation is adopted by this discussion.

2026-10-01 — Checked the operator's Erlang GC question against current official
ERTS collector and process/spawn settings. GC is integral to ordinary BEAM term
allocation, with per-process heaps and tunable collection/heap policies; no supported
general GC-free/manual-memory execution mode was found in the documented APIs.
This question does not establish a new operator prohibition on GC or adopt Erlang.

2026-10-01 — Operator proposes OxCaml as another stack candidate. Read official
OxCaml overview, allocation/mode/platform documentation, Jane Street's introduction
and the compiler's current otherlibs/dynlink/dynlink.mli. Relevant sources:
https://oxcaml.org/ ; https://oxcaml.org/documentation/stack-allocation/intro/ ;
https://oxcaml.org/get-oxcaml/ ; https://blog.janestreet.com/introducing-oxcaml/ ;
https://github.com/oxcaml/oxcaml/blob/main/otherlibs/dynlink/dynlink.mli .
OxCaml is a real production compiler with experimental/unstable extensions, allocation
control and race-checking modes; it retains GC rather than offering a generally
GC-free runtime. Native Dynlink supports compiled plugin registration but explicitly
cannot unload loaded compilation units. Discuss OxCaml/Lua or separate-process
extensions as alternatives to C++/Lua; selective allocation control is not a claim
of whole-harness deterministic latency. No compiler install, dependency adoption,
expanded corpus acquisition or runtime experiment occurred.

2026-10-01 — Operator points to RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus and Godot alternatives.
Read RCC++'s repository, author GameAIPro chapter and selected current source;
queried public repository metadata (HEAD 005c05145d98b87d974c36fc885003ea88bf3932,
2025-10-31). Its object swap serializes declared old object state, constructs new
objects, restores/initializes and deletes replaced objects; stable interfaces and
object identities matter. This is not arbitrary stack/heap continuation or a barrier
for concurrent provider/program effects. Read Godot's current GDExtensionManager
contract: reload_extension is documented editor-only and fails in release builds.
Read JENOVA/Sakura official hot-reload and requirements material: it advertises
editor/runtime C++ scripting reload; requirements explicitly list Windows/Linux,
while a Mac filename example alone does not establish macOS support. These are
research leads for live native governing programs, potentially making Lua optional;
no library/engine adopted, reference code executed or production program written.

2026-10-01 — Operator selects C++ with Lua scripting: native hot recompilation
via RCC++/Godot/similar, Lua for ephemeral tools, workflows and experimental
interfaces. Recorded the language decision in current README/AGENTS/FOUNDATION/
BEHAVIOR; runtime versions, reload mechanism and libraries remain open. Read
Rhizome's C++ rigor, representation, oracle/harness, formal-methods and editor
research read-only; adapted applicable ownership/diagnostics/simulation/oracle
work into papers/2026-10-01-cpp-rigor-seed.md. Reobserved local tool versions:
Apple Clang/format/clangd 17, CMake 4.3.0, Ninja 1.13.0.git.kitware.jobserver-pipe-1,
Lua/luac 5.4.8; standalone clang-tidy/LuaLS/luacheck absent on PATH. These are
availability queries, not qualification. No installations or reference execution.

A Lua frumentarius researched current primary sources and saved
papers/2026-10-01-lua-rigor-stack.md: ordinary Lua, LuaLS annotations/batch reports
and a narrow owned host binding lead; Lua 5.5.1 versus maintained 5.4.9 remains
a runtime proposal. Actual error/yield/C++ unwind boundaries, generation roots,
finalizers and checked operations are qualification subjects. Clarified that
deliberately ending standing work is not the refit preservation strategy.

Saved docs/STARTING_DESIGN.md as the requested basic architecture sketch toward
building Arconaut in Arconaut, not a complete specification or implementation
plan. Proposed foundation/live-native/Lua/client split and independent continuity
custody address real replacement constraints. Independent focused review found
two obligations, now added: preserved workers retain required native dependencies
or reach surviving owners over a protocol; audit observation/writer custody survives
outpost/build/main downtime. Rageshake external sink delivery, audit overload and
unknown effect outcomes remain explicit. No product code or dependency adoption.

Operator then supplied facebookresearch/context-language-models. Read its current
README and paper abstract; delegated exact acquisition/source study. Added directly
model-editable participant context to the sketch, exact revision/final-request
capture and explicit concurrent writer conflicts. The research pattern fits the
operator's context-as-local-data premise; benchmark claims are not adopted defaults.
Source-level study/acquisition report and manifest entries follow. Moved the
completed brief bead arconaut-ahb to closed and integrated design arconaut-8n8 to
in_progress; authoritative specification/review and implementation plan remain.

CLM acquisition/source study complete at 18dc11115f50f261233c5bba7937834491e307e8:
intact source ZIP, 75 clean extracted files and ignored paper PDF, catalog and both
quarantine manifests recorded. Source study identifies a command-boundary editable
context mirror, lossy historical-role/tool parsing, limited original capture,
snapshots before provider rewriting, contentless discarded replies and unreleased
subagent options. No source/benchmark executed. Integrated explicit structured
context preservation and clarified a proposed distinction: ordinary working-context
edits may affect the next request within the current program; replacing that
governing program follows deferred/interrupt activation. This is specification
input, not a change to the operator's activation decision. Both focused review
findings were reread as resolved at sketch scope. Local links in eight current
documents resolve; git diff --check passes. Beads backup taken after issue updates.

2026-10-01 — Operator includes CLM and its evolution in the first-pass core,
then explicitly checks literature/reference sufficiency before design and warns
that speed toward Arconaut must not permit haphazard work. Recorded CLM as a
first-milestone requirement in FOUNDATION/BEHAVIOR/STARTING_DESIGN/README/AGENTS:
model-authored live-context transformations and their evolution, repair from
originals, distinct context revisions and final provider-request capture.

Audited actual corpora against that first core. Existing source-grounded agent,
workflow, audit and CLM research supports behavioral work, but the new native/Lua
stack needed deeper acquired-source grounding. Sent three bounded frumentarii for
native reload, C++/Lua embedding, and durable custody through refit. Acquired six
clean pinned references: RCC++, fungos/cr, official Lua 5.5.1, its exact matching
tests, sol2 and LevelDB. Original source archives remain intact; Lua originals
retain published-checksum matches and derived ingestion ZIPs. Catalogs record
direct source-byte/executable-bit comparison and restoration; both manifests
updated. No imported build/program/test, installation, provider call or library
adoption. RCC++ GLFW submodule is absent in the upstream archive, explicitly noted.

Acquired/read RCC++ author chapter, current official reload docs, official POSIX
Issue 8 and installed macOS SDK 26.2 manuals. Added publisher PDF and catalog for
Pillai et al. OSDI 2014 application crash-consistency paper; read introduction and
persistence/update-protocol methods, without claiming current APFS qualification.
Read CLM formal editable-context and textual-evolution method sections. Root
spot-read actual RCC++ module loading, Lua private control transfer and LevelDB
log writer/reader source. Focused reports are dated 2026-10-01 native-reload-,
lua-embedding- and refit-custody-grounding in papers.

Material design constraints now have source anchors: loaded RCC++ modules do not
preserve destroyed objects; native fault recovery is not safe Lua/C++ unwinding;
Lua roots and raw continuation/finalizer pointers require explicit code custody;
descriptor transfer does not move parentage or action authority; stop requests
are not whole-tree pause completion; flush is not durable commit; salvaging a log
must not silently claim complete originals. Neither an owned append/blob protocol
nor the whole combined custody transfer exists yet; those are design obligations.

Saved papers/2026-10-01-design-readiness.md mapping each first-core question to
literature/read mechanisms and unresolved qualification. Independent review
supports entering ground-up specification, not implementation readiness. One
custody catalog path defect was normalized to the Arconaut-relative archive path
and reread as resolved; no unresolved readiness findings. Core contracts and
actual-host qualification remain for the reviewed design and plan. The initial
provider protocol remains a scoped study after provider selection. No product
implementation or authoritative architecture specification was written in this pass.

Operator asks what the baby TUI will be. Proposed a small owned C++ terminal client,
Lua-configurable commands/layout, conversation/composer/output detail/status,
visible first-core CLM, interruption/pending changes and attachment to the outpost.
Read archived terminal notes as historical reference only and current primary
xterm control-sequence and FTXUI documentation. Terminal profile, Unicode/input,
paste, resize, restoration and UI state continuity require explicit behavior and
direct verification; no framework is adopted or TUI implemented. Recorded the
proposal in STARTING_DESIGN. Client presentation loop does not govern execution.
Local links in 17 current documents and all six project-relative restoration paths
resolve; git diff --check passes. Research-ready means ready to specify and review,
not permission to skip design/qualification or a working-runtime claim.

2026-10-01 — Operator accepts baby TUI direction and requests comprehensive
testing with a short path from planning to execution. Wrote docs/CORE_DESIGN.md
as the ground-up first-core specification, with CLM and evolution in scope,
independent execution/audit custody, C++/Lua generations, and outpost refit.
Two bounded adversarial reviews cover admission/original/context attribution and
code/resource custody across reload/refit. Reports are in papers/2026-10-01-core-
context-review.md and papers/2026-10-01-core-lifetime-review.md. Initial findings
require explicit recoverable publication, workflow decision/action identity,
late-result branches, root/descendant activation gates, preserved paused pipes,
symmetric return settlement, migration failure disposition and nonblocking control
requests. Integrated those semantics for rereview before deriving the plan. No
product code or dependency adoption; the owned native loader remains a proposal.

Both specification reviewers reread integrated findings as resolved. Closed design
bead arconaut-8n8 at specification scope; qualifications are implementation-unit
obligations, not claims of runtime readiness. Derived docs/TESTING_PLAN.md and
docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with ten conceptual units and corresponding direct
oracle families, source-grounded legacy dispositions, scoped fault claims and
fleet-only mutation. Two independent plan reviews now attack oracle independence
and actual execution/lifecycle ordering. Marked arconaut-w8q in_progress. Updated
current entrypoints so historical brief/candidate status cannot govern new work.

Plan reviews found three bounded omissions: persistence schedules cannot silently
assume prefix-only survival; incoming provider originals need independent emitted-byte
comparison before decoding; owned IPC needs real fragmented/malformed/disconnected
wire checks and bounded fuzzing. Integrated all three into TESTING_PLAN and U3's
implementation qualification, then both reviewers reread them as resolved. No
remaining findings in the reviewed scopes. Planning is ready for U0's written
sub-plan and red examples; actual runtime/host/provider qualification remains future
implementation work. No product code, installations or dependency adoption in this
session. General reconnaissance is not a prerequisite to this execution handoff.

Closed reviewed-plan bead arconaut-w8q and created implementation epic arconaut-uaa
for U0-U9 qualifications, code reviews and actual self-development acceptance.
Beads refused a blocking epic-to-task edge; used a discovered-from relation to the
completed plan instead. Local links/whitespace pass for 13 changed current documents
(126 local targets); git diff --check passes. No application tests were represented
as run: this session completed design and planning, not implementation. Taking the
required current beads backup after these changes.

2026-10-01 — Operator asks whether the full rigor stack is present/configured.
Checked active repository files (excluding quarantine/research/working material)
and tool resolution: clang++, clangd, CMake, Ninja and lua/luac resolve; standalone
clang-tidy, LuaLS, luacheck, StyLua and Mull do not resolve on PATH. Earlier xcrun
clang-format availability remains separately recorded. No active C++ build presets,
compilation database, static-analysis configuration, sanitizer/fuzz profiles or
automated unit checks exist yet. Reviewed rigor plans are documentation, not an
installed/configured/qualified stack. No installations or implementation performed.

2026-10-01 — Operator authorizes configuration of the rigor stack, subscription-
backed Kimi independent review/test challenge and Jev assistance before core work.
Wrote docs/RIGOR_SETUP_SUBPLAN.md and created arconaut-6b7. Implemented development
CMake profiles and owned diagnostic/byte/thread/Lua capability probes, local LLVM
format/tidy/clangd settings, LuaLS/StyLua settings and scripts/rigor. These are
development tools, not the agent or production dependencies. Installed official
Homebrew LuaLS 3.19.1 and StyLua 2.5.2; Lua/luac 5.4.8 explicitly qualify only
the compatibility lane. Requested a fleet host/launcher; no answer yet. No mutant
execution, Linux-only qualification or production Lua 5.5 embedding is claimed.

Installed LLVM 21.1.0 compiled the probes but ASan deadlocked before main on
macOS 26.6. Captured the actual process sample and rejected the configuration.
Upgraded to LLVM 23.1.2 with required Z3, preserving the older keg and disabling
automatic unrelated dependent upgrades. A proposed unrelated Rust upgrade was
stopped before installation. Explicit compiler pins and fresh CMake caches remove
the rejected tool from this project's build path. LuaLS clean output encodes an
empty table as []; accepted that exact shape after reading actual reports. Native
CMake supplies the real Apple SDK; standalone negative analysis probes use the
actual xcrun SDK because Homebrew's default SDK path was absent. Full five-profile
qualification passes clean oracles and deliberate ASan/UBSan/TSan/format/tidy/
analyzer/Lua type errors, plus bounded property fuzzing. No instrumentation disabled.

Verified existing Kimi Code 2.1.1 subscription authentication/model alias. Installed
the related published kimi-delegate skill under its real name, then, following the
operator's clarification, codified an owned kimi-colleague skill for direct CLI
new/resumed conversation. Skill validation passes; published Node relay unused.
scripts/kimi-review retains raw stdout/stderr, binds the read-only profile and
explicit session ID, and owns timeout/signal/error child cleanup. Controlled
cases establish literal argument delivery, capture, continuation, restricted tools,
exit propagation and actual child termination. Two initial OAuth fetch failures
were retained; bounded retry succeeded. No new key/login/subscription required.

Jev uses the existing owned workspace client; read its guidance, implementation,
colleague experiments and live primary docs. scripts/jev-check.py snapshots bounded
explicit Markdown sections and questions, defaults to offline preparation, and
retains actual model/probabilities/usage for explicit live calls. One five-question
call succeeded with jev-1.13.0 (3,061 input / 217 output tokens). Construction-based
answers matched; this establishes setup capability, not calibration. Credential
contents were not inspected or copied. Python stays in development tooling.

Actual independent Kimi review found six defects in source enumeration, header
analysis, tool attribution, fenced-heading provenance, model attribution and
basename exemptions. Reproduced/integrated all and demonstrated actual failures
on their direct cases. Kimi rereview marked those resolved and found three smaller
gaps: preset/profile drift, directory symlink omission, and a post-spawn wait error
leaking the CLI child. Integrated those, widened the header diagnostic filter, and
ran direct pin/symlink/compiler/provenance/header/actual-child cases. One expected
CMake diagnostic literal was wrong in the owner case; retained that failed assertion
and corrected it. Debug checks pass after the final corrections. Kimi's final
same-session rereview reports all findings resolved and no consequential introduced
defect within read-only scope. Original reports and owner resolution live in papers.

Operator points to newly public EDG compiler. Frumentarius acquired the pinned
89e67e07c7f6d0fc38622f9778d8e79f40deaa0f source archive intact under shared quarantine
and studied actual front-end/backends, macOS configurations, language modes, testing
and licenses. EDG is an independent semantic language-check candidate; its native
backend, sanitizer and reload roles are not assumed. Initial generic ingestion
omitted 46 legitimate ._-prefixed expected-output filenames and 12 functional
symlinks. Restored those directly from the intact archive and documented the
catalog-driven override; retained all 111,061 non-directory entries. No source
archive/shared policy altered and no EDG build/test/imported code executed.
Updated project/shared manifests. Rhizome remains read-only; the study is available
as transferable evidence, not an adopted dependency or change to its decisions.

Updated active entrypoints and operational commands. Current stack is locally
qualified tooling plus independently reviewed Kimi/Jev utilities. Full fleet
qualification and production Lua embedding remain named work. No product core
implemented, Git commit/push performed or unrelated editor/shell configuration changed.

Final handoff checks: 16 changed/current documents have 167 resolving local links;
owned utilities parse and git diff --check passes. Updated arconaut-6b7 with local
completion and explicit remaining fleet work; kept it in_progress rather than
claiming full-stack completion. bd backup succeeded at 08:57:05 UTC with 10 issues,
61 events and 8 dependencies. No unsupported legacy JSONL export.

2026-10-01 — Active goal authorizes completing setup and executing the entire reviewed
U0–U9 plan with Kimi partnership. Revalidated actual worktree: local toolbox exists,
no product unit implemented. Wrote U0 sub-plan and opened arconaut-uaa.1. Kimi's
independent plan/oracle review found stale release, caller registry identity scope,
native-clock bracketing, temporary-buffer view rejection, deadline boundaries and
arithmetic/profile clarity gaps. Integrated explicit behavior and sharper direct
cases before writing product code; unsigned arithmetic is an implementation route,
not a second oracle layer. TSan will exercise shared immutable values only.

Operator selects Neuroses for Linux and Runpod for mutation. Verified existing SSH
access (Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64) and existing Runpod CLI/auth/account (about $73 credit,
zero pods). Installed minimal Clang 18.1.3/LLVM tools, libc++/libc++abi, CMake 3.28.3
and Ninja 1.11.1 on Neuroses without unrelated upgrades. Read current Runpod docs
and exact installed CLI source; its CPU create path silently omits terminate-after.
No Runpod pod created. Operator then explicitly accepts node termination responsibility
and postpones mutation until a working agent/mature suite, prioritizing working Arco.
Retired proposed automatic cloud plumbing and removed mutation as a current milestone
gate. Direct tests/sanitizers/adversarial review remain. Return to product U0 now.

2026-10-01 — Wrote U0 specification-derived identity/handle/byte/time/seam cases;
observed the genuine missing-foundation-header red before implementing production.
Implemented owned C++ foundation and real compile-negative API shapes. Initial
checks exposed a swappable Deadline constructor and a mistaken expected diagnostic
name; narrowed the constructor and checked actual nodiscard rejection. Moved-from
registry rejection is deliberate specified behavior; two exact test lines have
documented analyzer suppressions, with the general diagnostics unchanged.

Mac debug/release/ASan+UBSan/TSan direct cases and focused diagnostics pass. Neuroses
exposed function-name pair CTAD portability and libc++ 18's unavailable default
jthread. Replaced the test-table deduction with explicit function pointers and
qualified Linux explicitly against its installed libstdc++ 13, retaining all thread
oracles. Linux debug/release/ASan+UBSan and real API rejection cases pass. Captures
remain under context/u0-* and context/linux/run-phmu0mpz. Kimi's U0 plan rereview
is retained unrewritten; fresh actual code/oracle review is underway. No mutation,
provider call, production Lua linkage or usable-agent completion claimed.

Prepared the bounded U1 retained-state sub-plan from current audit/lifecycle
contracts, LevelDB log mechanisms and primary Apple sync documentation. Single
journal stops at capacity without overwriting history; exact framing/checksum,
sync/publication, semantic identity/dedup and emergency failure boundaries are
specified. Independent Kimi plan review runs while U0 review finishes. U1 product
implementation has not begun and depends on resolving those reviews.

U0 fresh Kimi code/oracle review found no consequential production or oracle defect.
Corrected the Linux runner's cleanup exception replacing its primary result; direct
injected cleanup failure preserves both successful checks and original test failure,
and another actual Neuroses run passes. Local debug profile passes after the final
CMake profile change. Kimi rereview resolves/withdraws all findings and reads the
actual Linux/probe evidence. Its cosmetic context-directory finding was incorrect:
context was already ignored under doctrine. Reports retain Kimi's exact statements
and limits; reviewer execution is never claimed. Closed U0 and opened U1. No usable
agent milestone is claimed by that foundation completion.

U1 plan review identified missing explicit recovery disposition, continuation
ownership, directory/create/lock interface, issuer rebuild and dependency encoding.
Integrated bounded U1 linked continuation and directory publication, a precise
112-byte lineage header, semantic references/replay checks, reservation burn rules
and clean-capacity versus poisoned writer distinction. Corrected the review's
implication that delivery acknowledgement can be read from disk: recovery stages
surviving complete batches, syncs them anew and labels acknowledgement unknown;
open attempts require reconciliation, never replay. An issuer returning an identity
before its required sync would violate the API; tests target actual reservation
non-reuse instead. Explicit-session plan rereview is underway.

Asked the operator for Arconaut's initial provider/model/account and exact Lua
runtime adoption ahead of their owning units. These answers do not block retained
state work. Kimi development authentication is not a production-provider selection.

U1 plan rereview confirms all five findings and capacity distinction resolved;
integrated its final exact flag validation and recovery-strength sentences. Wrote
CRC/header/frame direct red cases, then observed the missing journal header failure.
Implemented the owned bounded byte codec: explicit little-endian fields, CRC32C,
root/continuation headers and physical frame views. Known CRC vectors come from
RFC 3720 B.4 as identified in the read reference tests; expected frame CRC and field
offsets are fixed direct expectations, not encode/decode round trips alone. Source
damaging inputs enumerate each byte and truncated length. A first analyzer pass
flagged enum conversion before wire-kind validation; validation now checks raw kind
before conversion. Debug direct cases and focused diagnostics pass. Remaining U1
work is real storage/directory/lock, batch commit/recovery/chain semantics, semantic
ledger/issuer and emergency/complaint gates; codec alone is not accepted U1.

U1 byte codec passes Mac debug/release/ASan+UBSan and Neuroses ordinary lanes.
Read the actual SDK flock contract: advisory locking protects cooperating writers,
and inherited/duplicated descriptors share one lock; it is not process custody.
Direct OS probes show file and directory fsync/F_FULLFSYNC succeed on this Mac
filesystem; this is API observation, not a power-loss survival experiment.
Wrote missing-native-header red cases, then implemented owned journal directory/
file interfaces with exclusive creation, restriction/type checks, close-on-exec,
native exact I/O/sync and writer locking. Direct bytes/extent/read-only error and
cross-process independent-open lock cases pass locally.

An added unsupported-FIFO case exposed blocking open before fstat validation;
observed a two-second timeout red and added nonblocking open before file-type
rejection. No regular-file I/O semantics or admission contract changed. Mac
optimized/sanitizer and Neuroses runs are underway for the new native boundary.
Fresh Kimi early code/oracle review attacks this bounded byte/native component
while full U1 batch/ledger/recovery mechanisms remain explicit unfinished work.

Final native-boundary runs pass Mac debug/release/ASan+UBSan with focused analysis
and Neuroses debug/release/ASan+UBSan (context/linux/run-nxph0wdq). All five current
CTest cases pass; Mac-only TSan remains the completed U0 concurrency scope, not
a Linux TSan claim. Updated entrypoints and beads; supported backup succeeds.
Next work is U1 batch writer/recovery/dependency replay and semantic admission,
integrating actual findings from the pending independent byte/native review
(context/kimi-review/run-vdf39skd). The full U0–U9 goal remains active. No Git
commit/push or new provider/runtime adoption occurred.

Early byte/native Kimi review found predecessor-extent asymmetry and incoherent
frame/batch limits. Tightened both with overflow-safe geometry and source+commit
capacity, and added concrete boundary cases. Clarified that low-level file open
is not durable journal initialization; orchestration owns content/directory sync.
Added NativeJournalFile's explicit descriptor-exchanging moves and actual moved
source/destination case, symlink ELOOP detail, truncated exact short-read/untouched
tail, and read-only lock contention. The earlier request8/file4 case already
checked short reads; no false claim that this was absent. Initial new fixture
optional dereferences tripped analysis; replaced them with whole specified optional
values. Corrected cases and code pass Mac debug/release/ASan+UBSan with analysis
and Neuroses debug/release/ASan+UBSan (context/linux/run-1n_ub6vc). Original review
is retained; explicit-session resolution rereview is underway in run-jk4a540d.

Kimi byte/native resolution rereview (run-r1gygc3n) withdraws the read-only
flock defect: it conflated fcntl record-lock access checks with XNU flock. Kept
the strict contention oracle after checking actual named-host execution, the
installed SDK manual and primary XNU syscall source. Saved the unchanged final
review; no outstanding findings remain in that bounded codec/native scope.

Implemented the physical U1 batch writer after missing-header red: preallocated
indexes, complete batch preparation, exact short/EINTR writes, commit CRC and
post-sync publication; uncertain writes/sync failures poison admission. Recovery
stages complete contiguous batches without acknowledgement claims, preserves
damaged tails, resynchronizes file and directory before publishing physical
indexes, and leaves admission fenced pending reconciliation. Direct cases cover
every truncated first-batch length, independently surviving pending frame regions,
failed sync/write, capacity with no writes, changed originals and unexpected tails.
The latest local debug run passes six runtime cases; this physical component has
not yet received independent code review or its new Mac/Linux qualification.
Added an explicit recovery-directory-sync failure oracle before finalizing the
current check. Semantic ledger/dependency validation, issuer, continuation,
emergency capture and actual process-crash qualification remain unfinished U1.

Operator requested status: reported U0 accepted, U1 in progress, no working coding
conversation yet, and mutation/Runpod still deferred. Found the parent milestone
epic incorrectly closed while its implementation is unfinished; restored its
in-progress status rather than claiming the whole plan complete.

The directory-recovery debug check completed successfully: six CTest cases,
formatting, focused native analysis and Lua diagnostics pass. Rebuilt and ran the
new directory-sync failure case directly: failure poisons the writer and publishes
no staged records, with no additional writes. git diff --check and supported beads
backup pass. Full U1 acceptance remains pending the work recorded above.

U1 physical crash qualification now kills actual native writers at second-batch
write/source/commit, pre/post sync and returned-success boundaries. Another process
asserts exact extents/prefix bytes, staged count/cursor and closed admission; original
bytes are never truncated. Mac debug/release/ASan+UBSan and Neuroses same ordinary
lanes passed the first seven-case version (Linux run-t6xmhya6). Kimi independent
batch review run-j_dnnul5 returned one recovery cause classification correction and
concrete oracle gaps. Integrated multi-frame/count/CRC/batch-capacity, pending reads,
short/EINTR/zero reads, zero/impossible writes, interrupted sync, open profile/bounds,
allocation failures and native creation/directory crash cases. Retained its unchanged
report. During allocator tests, a fake storage vector copy assignment lost the old
synchronized snapshot on OOM; changed the model to prepare-copy/swap, preserving
acknowledged bytes. The initial failing model was not a production writer defect.

Concretized existing U1 semantic body kinds and wrote actual missing-header red,
then implemented owned typed reservation/decision/invocation/admission/open/observation/
retry/conflict/complaint codecs. Exact layout bytes, every truncation, bound/identity/
reserved/trailing rejection and real allocator failures pass. Analysis caught
convertible value/width arguments; replaced runtime encoder widths with compile-time
widths. Latest debug passes eight tests and focused analysis. New release/ASan and
Neuroses runs and separate Kimi semantic review are pending. This is not accepted
U1: authoritative ledger/source dependency validation, issuer, continuation/custody
and emergency controls remain necessary before U2 consumes retained state.

Batch rereview run-gtpluegk verifies F1-F9 resolved; unchanged final report
retained. The fixed multi-frame CRC was independently derived by a dev-only bitwise
script from the specified frame bytes. Allocation-sweep exhaustion fails safely.
A crash during recovery sync has the same clean-reopen aftermath already covered;
injected failed file/directory recovery sync checks publication failure directly.
Sequence exhaustion at the journal's integer guard remains hand-reviewed, not an
execution claim. Semantic codec review and rereview (run-cxm2amco, run-4bdd_w5s)
find no codec defects and verify all proposed negative/oracle additions. Unknown
schema plus malformed bounds may report corrupt before unsupported; the contract
requires rejection and does not specify exact precedence.

Final eight-test version passes Mac debug plus diagnostics and Mac release/ASan+
UBSan; the final negative-test additions pass rebuilt release/ASan target checks.
Neuroses debug/release/ASan+UBSan passes final source (run-blbpjtpl). Updated current
entrypoints/research links and U1 notes. No usable agent, full U1 acceptance,
production provider/Lua adoption or power-loss qualification is claimed. Next
owning work is RetainedState's end-to-end dependency/transition validation and
publication, recovered/uncertain duplicate discovery, once-consumed dispatch,
issuer burn/non-reuse, linked-head continuation and emergency controls. The complete
U0-U9 objective stays active; mutation/Runpod remain deferred. Supported beads
backup and git diff --check pass.

Implemented U1's root RetainedState owner after its actual missing-header red.
It validates source dependencies, decision/invocation membership and attempt/retry
transitions before writing and before recovery publication. Candidate ledger/source
state is prepared before I/O and swapped only after sync; uncertain prepared
identities remain discoverable without entering committed queries. Rejections retain
exact serialized proposals in source chunks. Added bounded rejected-submission and
adapter-receipt codecs; launch return is separate from operation settlement and can
arrive after a synchronous terminal observation. Semantic recovery veto rejects an
entire bad batch and its suffix while preserving original bytes and earlier state.

Direct owner tests cover unchanged duplicates, retained changed input, deliberate
new retry, callback reentry with owned input, failed admission, staged recovery,
failed custody verification, pending issuer reservation burn, exhaustion and actual
allocation cuts before/during I/O. Actual SIGKILL tests now straddle an independent
native external file effect: zero/one exact effect records survive, old recovered
attempts never execute again, and an explicit new attempt adds exactly one record.
These qualify process crashes, not device power loss or future U3 live workers.

New red cases found two query defects: failed post-effect recording omitted the
reconciliation indication, and a failed open sync reported admission's live evidence
instead of the uncertain attempt transition. Fixed both and observed green direct
tests. Ten-test Mac debug/release/ASan+UBSan profiles passed before the last query
correction; final checks remain pending. Neuroses rejected default optional emplace
for the private Snapshot aggregate; constructing the Snapshot explicitly fixed the
local build, with Linux rerun pending. Fresh independent Kimi owner/code/oracle
review is running in context/kimi-review/run-427j9dic. Full U1 remains unaccepted:
linked-head continuation, namespace entropy/nonreuse, pending-byte diagnostics and
preallocated emergency controls are unfinished. Root factories explicitly reject
continuation headers until the whole chain invariant is implemented.

Fresh Kimi root review completed; original reports and every rereview are preserved
unchanged in papers. B1's alleged escaping allocation was incorrect: FramedJournal
converts bad_alloc to a Result and RetainedState clears clean prepared state. Added
resubmission to every no-write allocator cut; Kimi withdrew B1. B2 exposed a real
legal-size multi-event rejection whose framing did not fit one batch. Reviewed a
specific correction before implementation: bounded source groups followed by a
linked marker, with exact intervening-commit sequences, all capacities preflighted,
and ordinary admission closed after partial capture failure. Direct red reproduced
the defect; final independent full-field 3976-byte proposal, cursor10/end5598,
partial sync/heap cuts and native SIGKILL after chunk group2 all pass. Orphan chunks
stay readable originals and do not manufacture rejection semantics during replay.

Integrated fresh retry decision per invocation, legitimate decision sharing across
different invocations, within-batch identity-conflict classification, phase/receipt
transition cases and a plain commit-less reservation burn. Kimi's N1 then identified
an obsolete single-batch proposal cap; replaced it with the actual encoded marker's
dependency capacity bound. New 4097-byte red became green. Kimi's subsequent proposed
four-byte fix was wrong: size > limit-4-bytes precedes size +=4+bytes and allows the
exact bound. The 41984/41985 boundary pair passes unchanged production and Kimi
withdrew that finding. Final scoped verdict reports no outstanding confirmed root
component defect. This does not accept whole U1 or qualify its unfinished machinery.

Final Mac debug ten-case run, formatting, native analysis and Lua diagnostics pass;
release/ASan+UBSan changed targets and final boundary cases pass. Neuroses full-suite
runs later hit native crash watchdogs under heavy observed I/O pressure (about 78%
stall time); failures are retained, not called passes. A direct traced run of final
codec/owner/native-crash cases passes in debug/release/ASan+UBSan; ASan native crash
takes about 28 seconds. LeakSanitizer was disabled only for ptrace incompatibility
in this diagnostic; ASan/UBSan remained enabled, with no leak qualification claim.
Raised native crash watchdogs to 60 seconds (no latency oracle asserted), and Linux
overall watchdog to 600 seconds. Added an explicit CTest filter to check-linux and
empty-selection failure; this prevents repeatedly rerunning unchanged I/O suites
while qualifying a narrow change. Final ordinary focused Linux rerun is pending.

Final ordinary focused Neuroses check completed successfully: retained_events,
retained_state and retained_state_crash pass debug/release/ASan+UBSan with normal
sanitizer settings (context/linux/run-ssncdjh8). Final source includes the exact
41984/41985 boundary oracle; no ptrace/LeakSanitizer override applies to this run.
Mac final boundary passes debug/release/ASan+UBSan and focused analysis; prior
ten-case debug run and diagnostics pass. The old full-suite timeout captures stay
available as host evidence, not mislabeled as successes. Root component qualification
and scoped independent review are complete; full U1 and the first-core milestone
remain in progress, with linked head/continuation, namespace entropy, raw pending
diagnostics and emergency capture/control next. Updated entrypoints/research index
and issue notes; no U1 closure, Git publication or production dependency adoption.

Proceeding with U1 environment authority/head selection. Read native renameat/fsync
primary manuals and existing storage/recovery contracts; wrote the concrete bounded
selector format, permanent-lock ownership, temp/sync/rename/directory-sync ordering,
closed-on-uncertainty behavior and direct crash/fault oracles in
U1_ENVIRONMENT_HEAD_SUBPLAN. This is selection metadata, not a second audit truth
or permission gate. Full chain/namespace/provisional integration remains explicit.
Fresh Kimi protocol review requested before implementation.

Kimi head protocol review/rereview completed successfully; original reports kept
unchanged in papers. Clarified nine points, including typed structural CAS (raw
reserved/CRC tokens unnecessary), bounded short/interrupted I/O, explicit generation
exhaustion, existing-head verification and busy reader semantics. Actual new Mac
head/native cases pass, including full-strength directory sync and competing
process exclusion across replacement. Own code inspection found initial creation
could overwrite an orphan preexisting head; wrote the preservation refinement and
added a direct red case, which failed as expected. Correcting that creation path
before independent code/oracle review. No chain or whole-U1 acceptance yet.

Head/native debug, release and ASan+UBSan Mac cases pass. Added bounded lock/read
interruptions, premature EOF/impossible counts, source/destination symlink and
same-inode rename refusals, and actual SIGKILL after completed directory sync.
Native analysis identified swappable integer helper parameters; replaced them
with compile-time field offsets/widths and typed expected process exits. Linux
debug/release pass; ASan exposed our test-only malloc-backed allocation override
missing sized-delete overloads used by libstdc++ filesystem cleanup. Added the
matching deallocation overloads; sanitizer checks remain enabled, with rerun
pending. This is a test-hook portability defect, not a production head failure.

Environment-head independent code review found no production defect and one real
oracle gap: field-negative cases were CRC-invalid and could not distinguish the
semantic checks. Added independent CRC-valid invalid fields and owner binding
oracles; final Kimi rereview resolves F1/F2/F3 and finds no remaining scoped defect.
Original head reviews/resolutions kept in papers. Native and scripted fault/heap
cases remain directly tied to bytes/actual process locks, not coverage or receipts.

Original inspection refinement independently reviewed; clarified separate bounded
read loop, exact errors and synthesized Blocked forwarding. Actual missing-API red
then owned implementation/green. Every 112..202-byte small-batch tail reconstructs
exactly, with no state publication, short/interrupted/progress-reset reads, bounds,
zero/impossible counts and heap failures. Public poisoned/blocked/recovered-pending
inspection preserves source and dispatch closure. Fresh code/oracle review running.
Wrote selected-chain continuation draft, explicitly identifying the missing owned
RAM source proposal, current-namespace reservation indexing and wire-layout decisions
that must be resolved before implementation. No whole-U1 acceptance claimed.

Final original-reader rereview initially alleged missing plain-Live evidence but
had skipped commitment(); its exact-byte Live read already existed at lines190-194.
Pointed to that case without adding redundant tests; Kimi explicitly withdrew the
scope error. Final scoped verdict has no confirmed code/oracle issues. Final changed
Mac debug/release/ASan+UBSan and Neuroses all-three profiles pass; final extra boundary/
extent/interruption/state oracles also pass on both hosts. Format and focused native
analysis pass. Original reports, incorrect finding and explicit withdrawal preserved.

Selected-chain protocol review/rereviews resolved fixed-body arithmetic (108 bytes
plus bounded attempt/capture entries), declared capture set, whole outer rejected
proposal lifetime, canonical ordering, same-candidate source references, legality
window, ancestor uncertainty dedup, physical range bounds and same-lock rescan.
Kimi final plan verdict is ready for red/code. Its aside claiming empty committed
prefix implies no uncertain submission is false: a first append can fail before
commit while RAM owns its original bytes. Recorded the counterexample as a required
red history; no implementation or whole-U1 qualification is inferred from review.

Resumed the user-authorized first-core plan after the status discussion. Revalidated
workspace/project doctrine, selected-chain subplan, current root implementation and
issue state. The preceding status-only goal turn made no implementation progress;
the next available action is the already-reviewed continuation protocol. Corrected
its stale draft preamble and recorded the dependency order: exact maintenance wire,
owned complete proposals, then selected-chain integration. Existing root machinery
must refuse maintenance events rather than accepting new variant alternatives by
default. No new dependency, survey or U1 acceptance is introduced.

Direct hand-derived maintenance vectors initially failed at unsupported kinds12/13.
Implemented exact RecoveryChoice/ProvisionalCapture codecs, canonical attempt and
capture ordering, bounded counts, error/phase/evidence/purpose fields and envelope
rules. Root live/replay rejects maintenance with Unsupported; complete framing
cannot legalize it. Exact empty/full vectors, every truncation, field negatives,
capacity/trailing/order cases and actual heap cuts pass. These codecs do not validate
selected-chain placement, custody or capture-set completeness.

The missing proposal-header API and pending-RAM accessor produced direct compile
reds. Factored the unchanged ARPROP01 encoder into an owned bounded codec and added
exact parsing. Root ordinary writes now own the full expected cursor, source bytes
and encoded events before writing. Failed diagnostic groups retain their full OUTER
rejected proposal; inner appends do not replace/clear it. Every byte cut of a first
source+decision submission retains its exact RAM packet while committed history
stays empty and effect count stays zero. Caller mutation/destruction, sync failure,
first/second/marker diagnostic failures, post-group OOM, clean refusal/publication
and a rejected wrong-journal/UINT64_MAX cursor are exercised directly. Reopening
does not manufacture the dead process's RAM packet. Existing large-rejection exact
3976/4097/41984 bytes and boundaries remain unchanged.

Mac full debug twelve-case execution and changed release/ASan+UBSan cases pass;
first Neuroses changed four-case all-profile run passes (run-e00z92ti). Native
analysis caught repeated optional accessor dereferences in test code; use one
explicitly checked borrow, with no suppression. Final additional wrong-cursor/
clean-outcome qualification is running. Kimi's first call failed with provider
connection error; two short attempts timed out during actual file inspection and
produced no complete verdict. Captures are retained; a fresh combined code/oracle
review now uses the normal 15-minute allowance. No review acceptance or whole-U1
closure is claimed while it is running.

Own inspection found a lifetime mismatch: a diagnostic extent-read failure closes
the physical writer as Blocked before any write, but the new packet-clearing branch
treated every non-Live state as unknown output. Added a direct no-write stale-input
case; it failed on an unnecessarily retained pending packet. FramedJournal's actual
append guard marks unknown writes Poisoned, whereas pre-write extent failure is
Blocked. Use that existing distinction only before any diagnostic group commits;
after a committed group the outer packet must survive any later failure. The red
case is now green alongside every write cut/group-failure oracle. No storage state
or ordinary admission is reopened by clearing cleanly refused RAM.

Final extent-refusal refinement passes Mac debug/release/ASan+UBSan and focused
native analysis, plus Neuroses all3 profiles (run-vsrnycjv); the previous final full
debug twelve-case/diagnostic run and four-case Linux run-ys17mo7j passed before
that narrow refinement. No test/analysis failure remains in the changed scope.
The normal-duration combined Kimi call ended with connection failure, not a verdict.
Two focused retries supplied actual source inline to avoid tool round trips; both
ended with OAuth token fetch failure before any assistant review. Exact terminal
results/captures remain in context (run-1w79mxyv, run-aeb5c54n, run-zm21_gz7;
earlier run-ll70psry/run-g4ogciyg/run-4ceygyfy). DNS resolves auth.kimi.com and a
credential-free HTTPS HEAD reaches it (404); this does not validate OAuth refresh
or warrant a new login. No credentials or auth files were read. Independent review
is pending, and prerequisite components are not declared accepted. Updated current
entrypoints/issue notes accordingly; full goal/U1 remain unfinished.

Next selected-chain execution must include a three-segment history with explicitly
increased capacities. The physical header declares payload/batch limits but not
file/index capacities; reviewed choice records carry old/new declarations. Pin how
historical declaration consistency and configured allocation bounds interact before
coding the replay owner, preserving the reviewed rule that untrusted declarations
cannot choose allocations. Also retain exact acknowledged-prefix checks and original
source routing under the same permanent lease. These are concrete integration
questions/oracles, not another general survey or selection of dependencies.

Revalidated current U1 state after the continuation request; the preceding turn
made concrete implementation/qualification progress, with independent review still
pending. Diagnosed Kimi Code2.1.1's native single-binary distribution as embedded
Node, not an assumed Python process. Plain Node24.7 fetch and IPv4 ordering alone
fail immediately with ETIMEDOUT; curl reaches the same auth host with about0.87s
connect time. Disabling family autoselection permits the real Kimi invocation to
refresh/use its existing subscription and return KIMI_TRANSPORT_OK (exit0). Giving
each address attempt3000ms also reaches public HTTPS, and a real scoped Kimi wire
review then completes with exit0 and exact session ID. No credential/auth files,
new login, insecure TLS or production dependency changes were involved.

The development utility will supply only that qualified3000ms Node address-attempt
setting to its own child when NODE_OPTIONS is absent. Explicit inherited Node
options remain authoritative; do not modify shell/global config or reviewer tool
permissions. Record the selected development transport profile without dumping
inherited values. Direct smoke/review and existing wrapper behavior qualification
are the useful checks; no separate network approval or retry loop is introduced.
Grounding: Node24.7 command-line docs for network-family-autoselection-attempt-timeout
and Kimi's documented proxy/direct-connection behavior. Existing failure captures
remain unchanged. The wire review found no production defect, two real small
oracle gaps and a scope limitation; resolve those before accepting the component.

Kimi maintenance-wire review/rereview completed with actual child0/status completed
and exact session IDs (run-hgdc5paw/run-dvgy19en). Tightened trailing-material error,
allocator-success content equality and unknown14-versus-malformed13 checks. The
prose arithmetic slip was explicitly corrected. Final scoped review finds no
production issue; remaining cosmetic repetition adds no independent fault class.

Kimi owned-proposal review/rereview completed (run-k3zoekxw/run-2mu6kh74). D1 was
wrong: commits consume sequence numbers, not record-index capacity. Added actual
max_records5/6 boundary pair; six exactly admits one prior semantic plus four chunk
sources and one marker (cursor10/end5598), five refuses cleanly before writing.
Kimi explicitly withdrew D1; the erroneous suggested production change was not made.
Closed G1/G2/G4 with extent failure after committed group1, precise Blocked/Poisoned
states, and later append refusal preserving the full packet without writes. G3 has
direct global allocation failure armed inside successful sync followed by successful
metadata/semantic publication. G5 withdrawn as redundant. Both scoped prerequisite
components now have resolved review and final Mac/Neuroses all3 checks plus focused
analysis (Linux run-397c9xcv); original reviews preserved unchanged in papers.

Wrote the concrete same-descriptor restage/actual-commit-prefix refinement, including
reuse of existing wire CRC in cached physical/source metadata to detect changed
acknowledged source frames, explicit CRC collision fault scope, historical write
fencing and prepublication metadata lifetime. Independent plan review is running
before implementing it. Linked owner/entropy/emergency controls and whole U1 remain
unfinished. Restored Kimi review is development tooling, not a product dependency.

Physical replay refinement plan review/rereview completed with actual child0,
status completed, and exact session (run-2i7s3ja5/run-n_to4wei). B1 pins cached
frame CRC equality and append/source metadata publication; B2 pins persistent
historical write fencing. Both resolved before product implementation. Original
reviews are preserved unchanged in papers; next-layer stale semantic prepared
snapshot discard remains explicit. Initial missing-API compilation was red;
implemented same-descriptor restage and exact commit-prefix selection, preserving
acknowledged metadata and existing CRC fault scope. Initial debug physical/root
checks passed. Expanded direct cases now attack CRC-valid source replacement,
every acknowledged-tail truncation, complete unknown-sync recovery, semantic
rejection/restage, concrete storage/header failures, interruption budgets, OOM,
reentrancy and actual native writer lease retention. Final independent code/oracle
review and host qualification are still pending; this is not whole U1 acceptance.

Expanded physical debug tests and Mac release/ASan plus Neuroses debug/release/
ASan+UBSan journal_batch/native/crash/root/head checks pass (run-pkwt31hd).
Full local debug12 passes. Focused diagnostic caught an unchecked optional in the
new test itself; made the presence check explicit, without suppression, and reran
changed-unit analysis. Independent physical code/oracle review run-cjadwsni is live.
Wrote the next-layer capacity declaration/configured-allocation refinement from
actual header and choice codecs: explicit root policy, linked old/new consistency,
independent scan/history bounds, authoritative prefix versus diagnostic suffix,
and required three-segment growth oracle. It remains pending independent review;
no selected-chain owner implementation or whole-U1 acceptance follows from current
physical checks. Existing root RetainedState contains a single-segment counter and
source router; it must not be repurposed unchanged for cross-segment history.

Physical code review completed (run-cjadwsni, exact session_b26a8519-4e2f-470c-
8241-c626804090a3, child0). O1 multi-record split oracle was added independently
while review was running; extended it with a CRC-valid combined-batch history whose
original first source checksum is unchanged but old acknowledged commit disappears.
O2 now attacks prepend ordering with a complete uncommitted third source. D1 requires
unknown-write Poisoned to survive failed source inspection; D2 clears stale staging
metadata after confirmation. New direct payload-reentrancy red exposed an additional
state mutation entry point: read_payload could block the owner mid-restage. Wrote
these small state/metadata refinement rules before implementation; original review
will be preserved unchanged. Historical flag oracle now omits reselection, so it
actually detects a restage that wrongly clears the flag. No whole-U1 acceptance.

Physical review D1 and D2 have actual failing direct red state/empty-staging
assertions before fixes; read-payload reentry red was separately observed. Implemented
sticky Poisoned read failures, Busy payload validation during restage, and nonallocating
staging clear after confirmation; debug physical/native/root checks pass. Capacity
review (run-z_q0cb39, child0) identified a real missing independent framing ceiling
before scratch reserve, root-only absent anchor qualification, conversion operands
and local rule clarity. Added explicit typed ceilings, no narrowing/clamping, immutable
old_limits consistency and noncommit accounting. Root-only capacity is trusted input
until first choice persists it; linked history then rejects mismatch. This is truthful
about the accepted header rather than inventing a field it never stored. Both reviews
preserved unchanged; exact-session rereviews and final changed qualification follow.

Final changed Mac debug/release/ASan+UBSan physical/native/root checks and focused
analysis pass. Neuroses all3 journal_batch/native/crash/root/head profiles pass
(run-zhqbapeo). Full debug12/rigor passed before the small independent-review
refinements; subsequent checks directly cover the changed read/state/selection
fault classes without renaming earlier results as current whole-suite execution.
Physical exact-session rereview run-gn7rm2xb confirms O1/O2/D1/D2 and reentrant
payload/flag oracle resolutions. Its residual claim that the mid-batch restage
guard was redundant is wrong: actual uses staged_[selected-1], i.e. original source0
when selected==1, not the combined batch's last source. Both inferred boundaries
remain203, so the next-record batch-finality guard is essential. Sent this concrete
operand correction and requested current written-contract inspection in the same
session (run-fehd7_3d); no mutation test or production alteration used.
Capacity rereview run-mbqhahel confirms all5 refinements resolved. Minor existing-rule
aside is mistaken: choice old limits==predecessor header is already pinned later in
this same sub-plan (current line364). Clarified validated header limits may narrow
scratch within independent ceilings; unchecked values cannot choose allocations,
and wire capacity policies cannot choose configured reserve budgets. This removes
overstrong wording without changing the bounded allocation contract. Exact owner
API/global snapshot counting is the next written refinement, not code acceptance.

Physical final rereview run-fehd7_3d completed child0/status completed in the exact
session. Kimi explicitly withdrew its false redundancy/guard-blindness claim after
checking actual operands, read current written contracts, and found no open scoped
findings. Preserved final reply unchanged in papers and wrote physical resolution/
qualification note with exact final host scope, original red failures and remaining
whole-owner work. Entry points now reflect scoped physical acceptance; no whole U1,
U2, usable-agent or power-loss claim. All review/build/native/Linux handles are terminal.

Continued from the accepted physical component; preceding goal turn made actual
code/oracle/host/review progress. Revalidated current root semantic owner/head/wire
and plan. Wrote complete environment-owner API/lifetime/snapshot-accounting refinement
before product code: reuse one existing semantic validator under permanent head lease,
owned old descriptors, explicit provisional-byte/history budgets, namespace-scoped
reservations, proposal result preallocation, exact semantic acknowledgement containment
and candidate publication. Whole continuation acceptance remains one invariant, not
standalone smaller substitutes. Independent design review precedes deriving its reds.

First environment refinement review capture run-j7p1nsun has no terminal result or
assistant verdict. After the continuation, unified process handle26122 is missing;
actual process enumeration confirms neither review wrapper nor Kimi child remains.
Preserved partial events/stderr unchanged; this is interrupted/unreviewed, not a
verified live wait or acceptance. Source inspection independently exposed initial
creation lifetime ordering: consuming EnvironmentHead.create failure could destroy
borrowed directory before prepared root. Refined private allocation/publication phases
so environment owns directory before creating root, with public head create behavior
unchanged. Pinned active versus origin cursors, source-only provenance, refusal of
mixed uncertain/new proposals, local unpublished semantic staging/reentry closure,
and separate leased raw bad-header diagnostics before retrying independent review.

Derived the first integrated three-segment oracle from actual accepted wire fields:
root source+decision payload155 ends seq3/390, counter1 reservation seq5/494;
empty-maintenance child choice seq2/316, source+cross-parent invocation seq5/526,
fresh-namespace counter1 seq7/630; second child choice seq2/316 and cross-parent
admission seq5/526. Exact accumulated-entry boundary10 refuses entry11 AttemptOpen
before dispatch. These tuples will test source routing, shared semantics, namespace
reset and admission accounting directly. Read Rhizome C++ type/lifetime research
read-only: its owner-relative bounds warning fits this source-routing/snapshot work;
no library or project instructions adopted.

Pinned a lasting continuation_required admission latch separately from the temporary
Busy guard and physical journal state. Without it a failed candidate could leave an
internally Recovered predecessor that reconcile incorrectly resumes despite surviving
uncertainty. Only acknowledged new head/cache publication clears that operation state;
unhealthy head requires fresh reopen. This is a plan clarification, not implemented
behavior. Independent review retry run-9w_15kuq remains confirmed live under handle19261.

Owner refinement review retry completed child0/status completed in exact session
session_ef70fb70-196d-4ce8-a312-1cc72ebc6147 (run-9w_15kuq); report preserved
unchanged in papers. F1 moves authority preparation/acquisition before root journal
creation and leaves selector publication afterward. This both serializes creators
and preserves borrowed-directory failure lifetime; public Head.create composes phases.
F3 adds active namespace/counter and namespace-qualified pending burn storage. F4
uses Conflict and retained outer rejected input for mixed uncertain/new proposals,
not a false transient AuditUnavailable. F2 gets explicit bounded temporary capture_only
references before ordinary dependency admission across source-only commit groups.
Clarified that previously acknowledged root rejected-input sources remain retained
known bytes under its accepted contract; new purpose1/purpose2 provisional maintenance
chunks never become ordinary source authority. Predicted uncertain sequences and
state-nonmutating raw inspection now explicit. Exact-session rereview follows;
no product implementation begins before resolution.

Pinned old-proposal dedup before new active profile's size checks: changing framing
limits must not make exact uncertain resubmission fail Capacity before lookup. Whole
source/event equality is distinct from single-event equality; new/changed sources
around equal uncertain events are rejected mixed input, not silently promoted. Input
order in owned results stays intact while repeated equal ordinary identities dedup
to their first semantic record. These concrete API points will be included in the
same reviewed refinement, not improvised during candidate publication code.

Exact-session owner rereview run-5q7w9tbz completed child0/status completed; all4
findings resolved and the manual three-segment payload/sequence/end/count tuples
independently checked exactly. New namespace-uniqueness note is already required by
the accepted full selected-chain and entropy sections, so not an omitted whole-plan
invariant; restated both journal-ID and namespace checks locally to remove ambiguity.
Clarified purpose1-only captured ordinary dedup, composed state latches, and scope
of provisional original sources versus acknowledged root diagnostic bytes. Final
focused rereview also includes dedup before narrowed active-profile size refusal,
full-proposal versus event equality and result-order identity handling; code remains
unstarted until that concrete refinement is resolved.

Final owner refinement rereview run-oq6sjnlf completed child0/status completed. Latest
clauses ready subject to explicit create root validation, now pinned through existing
header encoder which already refuses zero namespace. Its note that semantic dedup
requires suppressing physical duplicate frames is incorrect: root apply keeps one fact
while retaining original physical positions. Physical suppression would invalidate
ARPROP01 event-ordinal provenance. Explicitly pinned retained frames/first semantic fact
and requested focused withdrawal; no code alteration follows the mistaken note.
Internal Head prepare/publish_initial phases named for direct construction tests and
environment ownership, with no ordinary model/admission API. Plan's material findings
are resolved; this construction step can proceed to direct red while correction runs.

Owner plan correction run-_dy36edm completed child0/status completed. Kimi withdrew
its physical-duplicate-suppression recommendation because it would corrupt packet
ordinal provenance, and withdrew zero-namespace permissive-codec claim after checking
existing header validation. Four material owner findings remain resolved; reviewed
refinement is ready for red/code, whole owner still unaccepted. Added missing-phase
API compilation red (4 errors), then factored Head.prepare authority lease/declaration
from publish_initial selector/healthy publication while preserving create composition.
Initial debug head suite green. Expanded exact failure matrix write/sync/rename/dirsync,
borrowed-root inspection after failure, initial-operation no-retry, reentrant Busy,
unexpected head preservation, zero-root-namespace no-I/O, and direct post-final-sync
allocation-cut success. Native tests now exercise held lease before root creation and
SIGKILL before/after initial selector rename/after directory sync with originals intact;
no environment fallback or power-loss claim. Code review/qualification follow.

New Head preparation phase final Mac debug/release/ASan+UBSan and focused analysis
pass, including native cross-process custody before root creation and actual initial
selector SIGKILL cuts. Linux check run-c65961ll failed before remote workspace creation
with SSH kex_exchange_identification connection reset; no remote build/test ran.
Independent BatchMode/ConnectTimeout readiness probe also reset (exit255); this is
remote access failure, not a test failure or qualification pass. Independent code/oracle
review run-5f5qk9gu remains live (handle83934). Component acceptance and whole U1 remain
unfinished pending review/actual Linux checks; useful local continuation work is possible.

Head creation review run-5f5qk9gu completed child0/status completed with no blocking production defect. Added its direct oracle gaps: initial-publication allocation failure sweep, correctable invalid sync strength, repeated healthy publication zero I/O, and non-ENOENT absence-check errors. Final changed debug/release/ASan+UBSan pass; focused analysis completed. Exact-session rereview run-t3r9m9w_ underway. Canonical Tailscale and verified-host-key LAN readiness both reset SSH before any tests; Linux remains pending, no access-policy changes.

Resumed the reviewed environment owner construction with a real missing-header compilation red. New integration fixture builds independently selected root/child/grandchild bytes through qualified framing APIs, pins seq/end and facts/source count from the reviewed manual table, counter1 across fresh namespaces, cross-journal source/parent use, exact history budget, and refuses wrong capacity/namespace/bounds. These are owner tests, not claims of a completed continuation. Whole U1/U2-U9 remain unfinished.

Head-phase exact-session rereview run-t3r9m9w_ completed child0/status completed, all four oracle gaps resolved with no new scoped defects; final report preserved unchanged in papers. Mac final changed debug/release/ASan+UBSan/analysis pass. Linux qualification remains pending after canonical and same-known-host LAN SSH resets; no remote tests were run.

Environment construction root + independent three-segment replay tests green, including correct historical descriptor routing and namespace-qualified counter1 reservations. Added direct red duplicate-position result case, then corrected results to reference the first semantic record while retaining both physical frames. Added direct red historical-source checksum corruption: old descriptor correctly refuses bytes but active owner wrongly remained Live. Latched ordinary admission closed on actual retained-source corruption while leaving raw inspection available. Shared existing semantic validator now handles bounded snapshot accounting and namespace-qualified reservations; no second validator was introduced. Required captures/checked-choice lists still close with Unsupported while their integration is being built; live continuation and emergency controls are unfinished and U2 cannot depend on this construction stage.

Environment construction review run-1we8bi0b completed child0/status completed; original report preserved unchanged. F2 real missing choice range predicates exposed by two direct histories and corrected. F1 valid all-existing source-free proposal gap exposed by direct red and corrected before active-profile encoding; no mixed-proposal filtering, which would break retained physical ordinals. Clarified whole-proposal versus per-event existing flags, stale rejection and non-dispatching recovered-pending queries in the written subplan. New direct narrowed-profile case retains an old 752-byte event under a 256-byte active payload limit with zero cursor movement while new oversized work refuses. Historical semantic invalidity now has a direct Corrupt refusal case; active semantic invalidity retains only choice prefix with closed admission and original tail bytes inspectable. Unsupported capture guard is directly exercised; known nonterminal prior admission cannot use an empty choice list.

F3 clean-report recommendation is incompatible with legal historical suffix damage: the existing cursor guard already compares the exact selected boundary, after physical prefix selection. New direct fixture appends then corrupts unselected historical suffix bytes (extent585), keeps authoritative prefix5/494 and reads the rejected bytes raw; it opens without granting that suffix source authority. F4 source-error taxonomy replaced by actual physical validation-report/state change under a read Busy guard. Pure lookup/allocation refusals leave health unchanged; actual old-source validation failure closes the environment as the accepted physical protocol requires. No implicit transient retry or new independent health enum added. Final rereview/qualification follows. Capture/checked-set integration and live continuation remain unfinished.

Operator requested a current phase breakdown. Checked the implementation plan, continuation subplan and final independent construction rereview. Kimi run-zwmpea6h reports no material scoped defect; final mixed-proposal oracle passes Mac debug/release/ASan+UBSan and focused analysis after typed fixture options. Updated U1 bead to distinguish implemented construction from unfinished capture/checked-state validation, live publication, diagnostic/emergency paths and integrated qualification. Current Linux checks remain pending after SSH failures before testing; U1 remains in progress and U2-U9 are not accepted.

Wrote U1_CAPTURE_SUBPLAN for the next continuation invariant: classify complete chunk/marker groups before ordinary sources, bounded exact original packets and uncertain indexes, packet-position versus semantic-reference query results, and complete committed/provisional custody sets. Pinned committed prior-evidence normalization on reopen (historical Live/RecoveredPending/Recovered are not reconstructible as current evidence), purpose2 refused-input framing distinction and literal first capture length214/child end754/history entries4. Independent plan review requested before product changes; full U1 scope remains intact.

Capture plan review run-0at6ewsg completed child0/status completed in session_1712db0e-375a-4cb1-b5c0-506e202d894a; original report preserved unchanged. Kimi checked all214/152/68/352/754/4 literal oracles. Clarified F1 every semantic record in maintenance region must be a validated marker (the existing marker-before-ordinary rule already forbids the example, now explicit at the skip mechanism), and F3 changed uncertain capture bytes reject the segment. F2 identifies an unpinned later ordinary frame matching uncertainty, but suggested retrospective promotion conflicts with the no-promotion/idempotent-no-write contract; pin active batch Conflict rejection and historical-boundary refusal instead. Purpose1 maintenance events and original declared record policy, non-keyed exact-position suppression and reservation query namespace now explicit. Exact-session rereview requested before implementation.

Capture refinement exact-session rereview run-plblrqdb completed child0/status completed, resolves all three findings and explicitly withdraws retrospective promotion recommendation. Purpose1 record-policy/maintenance exclusion, non-keyed exact-position suppression and reservation namespace query clauses independently checked; no new material findings. Preserved report unchanged and updated plan status. This permits direct red and implementation; no whole-U1 acceptance implied.

Initial capture implementation follows actual missing-API compilation red and runtime Unsupported red. Added owned provisional originals and uncertain indexes to the single snapshot/budget, complete chunk/marker classification before ordinary sources, origin-bound packet parsing, identity/namespace dedup, full-packet positional queries and exact individual uncertainty queries. First empty-root214-byte capture has choice2/end352 and marker4/commit5/end754; budget3/byte213 refuse and byte214 succeeds. Split source-only commits have independently derived end763/source-only and922/decision. Required captures absent/interrupted refuse Conflict instead of the temporary Unsupported guard. Attempt-related captures and checked lists deliberately still refuse Unsupported pending complete collector integration. Exact uncertain mixed input uses rejected-input evidence, not false changed-identity evidence. Code review/qualification remain pending, whole U1 unfinished.

Expanded direct capture oracles: 906-byte packet combining752-byte authoritative decision with duplicate47-byte uncertain complaints under active256 payload, child8/end1614, exact history budget6 (5 refuses), whole original positions4/5/6 vs first semantic records2/5. Purpose2 captures1619 bytes with foreign/MAX caller cursor and1500-byte refused source plus syntactic admission; child6/end2215, no uncertain attempt/source authority; same input labeled purpose1 refuses Conflict. Initial focused analysis caught a nested optional-access warning, corrected via named checked reference. Final changed debug/release/ASan+UBSan three affected suites and focused analysis/format/diff pass. Initial capture code review run-g8gyjg0k is confirmed live under handle31526; no reviewed-code/whole-U1 acceptance claim. Canonical Neuroses readiness still timed out before any Linux tests.

Operator rejected further ceremony and corrected the critical path: useful Arconaut-in-Arconaut coding is milestone one, with gaps repaired from that environment. Revised IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN directly without Kimi challenge, as explicitly requested. Bootstrap uses the qualified single-journal RetainedState path; full continuation/capture/custody, native hot replacement, independent-outpost refit and external complaint DB follow useful coding. CLM stays in milestone one. Updated AGENTS/README/testing and U1 subplans so prior full-U1 and full-refit dependencies cannot silently reassert themselves. Stop U1 expansion now; next work is retained context operations, local coding tools, Lua workflow, one provider and thin terminal interaction. Full first-core scope remains later destination; no unfinished issue is marked complete.

Operator selected OpenAI and said send it. Read official Responses function-calling and conversation-state docs; bootstrap retains raw/opaque output items locally, maps tool results by call_id and uses store:false. Announced installed curl program for transport and installed chosen Lua runtime with owned bindings; no transport/binding SDK introduced. OPENAI_API_KEY absent in environment and workspace .env; asked for credential source without requesting secret values, while continuing owned implementation. Wrote short BOOTSTRAP_NOTES and began JSON/context/tool vertical path, with no further Kimi plan gate.

Operator selected the same OpenAI login Codex uses. Read official OpenAI authentication and new public ChatGPT-plan OAuth docs, then studied quarantined Codex AuthDotJson, getAuthStatus and provider routing. Existing file-backed auth mode is chatgpt; no token values printed. Installed native codex-cli0.160.0 initialize/getAuthStatus works. Chose native Codex solely as sign-in/refresh authority, never its thread/turn engine: Arco owns native requests, Responses item handling and subsequent CLM/tools/workflow. Account pinned before/after RPC, reload requires returned token to match current file, and Arco never rotates/writes shared credentials. Initial live GET showed public API catalog403 versus matching Codex subscription catalog200/10 models; new partner OAuth routing is a distinct registered-client flow, not entitlement inferred from this cache.

Owned JSON direct compilation red confirmed missing header, then green exact-number/opaque-field/Unicode and malformed/limit contracts. Owned OpenAI stream test had genuine missing-symbol link red. Native bridge uses posix_spawn pipes/poll, bounded response collection, process cleanup, private curl config on stdin, fixed provider host and HTTP status-only failures. Native authentication fixtures check RPC sequence, child-only CODEX_HOME, refresh handoff, account-switch rejection, missing/wrong credentials, absent credentials in argv, JSON/config escaping, bounded output and401 metadata. First escaping fixture literal was wrong; corrected its independent expected curl-config bytes. Initial compilation found std::quoted ADL collision and missing signal/algorithm includes; corrected directly.

Live native Arco inference completed but first oracle failed: terminal response.output was empty. Studied behavior and retained complete response.output_item.done events in output_index order; reject duplicate/gapped/conflicting finals and incomplete/failed streams. Direct sparse-final tests now cover this actual backend behavior. Subsequent live gpt-6.1-sol request returned exact ARCO_LOGIN_OK. This qualifies authentication and native provider connection, not a completed coding agent or audited integrated workflow. Focused Mac debug/release/ASan+UBSan checks pass; static analysis caught adjacent interchangeable RPC message/id arguments, removed redundant ID parameter by deriving it from outgoing request. Final post-fix checks follow. Linux and independent code challenge remain pending; operator explicitly put Kimi challenge later. CLM, coding tools, Lua workflow and terminal integration remain current milestone work.

Final authentication-bridge RPC fix: Mac debug JSON/auth/stream checks, release and ASan+UBSan auth/stream checks, focused static analysis, format and diff checks pass. Final native catalog check again accepts the existing ChatGPT sign-in with10 models; no repeated paid inference needed after the RPC argument cleanup. Keychain-only import and Linux provider qualification are not claimed. Milestone one remains in progress.

Implemented the useful coding vertical slice directly under the operator's
sequencing override: typed application records in the root ledger, retained context
CAS edits and immutable originals/repair, owned local file/process tools, owned Lua
5.4.8 bindings and reload-at-turn source, native OpenAI integration and terminal.
Direct tests exercise wire kind14, duplicate/conflict handling, context stale/invalid
rejections and reopen/repair, opaque JSON and exact numbers, actual file/process
effects, call/result linkage, source captures and provider interrupted unknown
outcomes. No new SDK, production Python or permission gate was introduced.

Live Arco self-development session context/live-bootstrap first read source but
hit the provider deadline; incomplete streamed calls were not dispatched. Resumed
with a qualification-only low-reasoning Lua program. The model added an actual NUL
command regression, demonstrated red exit1 (refused=0, marker_created=1), corrected
src/tools.cpp, rebuilt arco/tools_test, then ran direct green and CTest tools1/1.
Parent inspection confirmed the source/test change. No staging/commit occurred.

Own review found ordinary Lua libraries could bypass the audit path. Written
subplan and direct red preceded selective pure-library loading; host effects use
arco.call, print uses retained display, raw file loaders and io/os/package/debug
are absent. Direct green checks exact retained print bytes, not just display
existence. Lua meta API declarations support real workflow diagnostics. Remote
source bundle now includes programs; Linux testing remains pending after earlier
SSH failures. Full continuation/refit/custody remains deferred and unfinished.

Final debug19/19 and affected release10/10 plus ASan/UBSan10/10 tests pass. Two
explicit live restart follow-ups failed with curl exit35; unknown outcome and raw
000 status retained. A system-curl handshake and authenticated catalog succeed,
so TLS failures are reported as observed rather than claiming provider continuity.
A third bounded follow-up is underway. No automatic replay was added.

Third live follow-up completed on the rebuilt executable in the same session:
recalled the actual NUL correction and red/build/green results without tools,
returned ARCO_CONTINUITY_OK, exit0. This verifies explicit restart conversation
continuity, not automatic refit. Prior TLS failures remain original history.

Complete owned-source lint passes: C++ format, compilation-database source/header
reachability and clang-tidy, Lua formatting/parsing/LuaLS with owned API meta
declarations, and the Lua contract probe. No new warnings or diagnostic suppressions
were added. Local evidence is debug19/19, affected release10/10 and ASan/UBSan10/10;
independent review and current Linux execution remain separate pending work.

Live model-authored CLM exercise completed exit0 in the same self-development
session. Lua tool selected the first user entry, saved its JSON, retained an
accepted temporary presentation edit, restored from its original and returned
edit_accepted=true/exact_restoration=true for entry
4800f4f39e2730420900000000000000.0; assistant returned ARCO_CLM_OK.
Parent inspected retained operation.result rather than trusting assistant prose.
The bounded local coding milestone is achieved. Full-core epic stays in progress;
independent integrated review, Linux qualification, owned OAuth, native refit and
advanced recovery remain substantive follow-up work.

Closed local milestone arconaut-uaa.3; opened arconaut-uaa.4 for independent
integrated/Linux qualification and arconaut-uaa.5 for replacing the accepted
Codex authentication scaffold. Beads backup succeeded (15 issues,95 events,13
dependencies). No Git staging, commit or push performed. The final live sessions
are exited; operator can resume context/live-bootstrap with scripts/arco.

Operator tried Arco and reports hello-world works but it is not ready to develop
itself. Refocused immediate work on comfort/responsiveness and a basic TUI. Earlier
vertical-slice evidence stands; its readiness claim is superseded and transition
acceptance is reopened. Wrote INTERACTIVE_LOOP_SUBPLAN. Adopted naming convention:
our machinery gets the plain noun; external implementations are named explicitly.

Implemented incremental assistant preview after original stream capture, final
message reconciliation through arco.present, file/command details, process streaming
and exit/errors, explicit medium default with CLI/Lua/interactive effort controls.
Cancellation reaches subprocess polling/auth/curl, pure Lua instruction execution,
and effect boundaries. Interrupted exec/provider outcomes remain unknown; pending
call outputs are settled as interruption records so the next turn is legal, with
no automatic effect retry. Direct coding fixture checks preview before provider
return, no final duplication, interruption after visible preview, actual stopped
exec with retained output/unknown outcome and a successful subsequent request.

Added C++ TUI with conversation viewport, persistent activity/timing, multiline
composer, bracketed paste, UTF-8 codepoint editing, prompt history, scrolling,
resize and queued prompts. One worker handles the entire turn; terminal thread
handles presentation/input only. Ctrl-C stops work, clears queue and retains draft.
PTY check exercises paste, resize, Lua/process interruption, child-group cleanup,
queue clearing, later work, terminal restoration and session reopen. First equality
oracle failed only on Darwin PENDIN bookkeeping; SDK termios.h identifies it as
retype-pending-input state, so compare configured mode with that bit excluded.
Expanded narrow-terminal oracle exposed clipped queue/timing behind long command;
moved critical status ahead of command and direct check is green.

Live OpenAI low-effort test read programs/turn.lua, ran terminal CTest and returned
ARCO_INTERACTIVE_OK (exit0); raw request/results remain in context/interactive-live.
Observed first stdout28.075s/total37.811s for that multi-request exercise; no earlier
benchmark supports a total speedup claim. It exposed command with argv:[] refusal
and an extra model round trip. Added actual red tools case (invalid_range exit1),
then made empty argv fall back to command while nonempty argv retains precedence.
Errors now appear to the operator. This removes that observed avoidable round trip.

Kimi colleague skill used for scoped concrete TUI/cancellation review through
read-only CLI profile, run-qlqk5wqn. Review is underway, not claimed completed.
Final affected checks/analysis follow; full Linux and core recovery remain pending.

Initial interactive Kimi review run-qlqk5wqn completed exit0 in explicit session
session_da7b7d88-8e63-4a91-8635-f8bb3f97fe75; report preserved unchanged in papers.
Valid high-priority finding: busy-loop pre-interception treated pasted Ctrl-C data
as cancellation. Composer now solely classifies input and preserves draft on cancel.
Idle-clear had been explicitly documented rather than a concealed contract defect;
adopted the review's suggested uniform draft-preservation behavior, with Ctrl-U clear,
and adjusted its direct oracle (actual red before code). PTY covers pasted Ctrl-C
during active work and continued shell liveness before explicit cancellation.

Additional material refinements: no preview for deltas without item identity, so
anonymous final items cannot falsely reconcile; non-EINTR poll failure unwinds
rather than spins; exec fixture now stops on actually observed output instead of
a tight wall-clock window, finds the result by call_id and asserts unknown terminal.
Actual child-group death is already checked by the PTY oracle. Deliberate corrected
final-text display and custom workflow error/context-repair behavior are documented.
Pasted ESC remains original data, safely rendered; stripping it would corrupt input.
Changed debug4/4, release4/4 and ASan/UBSan4/4 plus focused analysis pass after these
fixes; prior final six affected cases were green. Lua format/parse/LuaLS pass after
correcting the development check's relative metapath invocation (not suppressing
35 spurious missing-standard-library diagnostics). Exact-session Kimi follow-up
run-qmmgf4er is underway. No Git staging/commit/push or mutation run performed.

Exact-session interactive rereview run-qmmgf4er completed child0/status completed:
all substantive corrections sound, no remaining high-priority scoped defects.
Report preserved unchanged. Addressed its minor findings directly: idle Ctrl-C
preserves status too; completion says stop requested (intent), rather than falsely
asserting an effect was stopped in a completion/cancel race; PTY checks the pasted
control byte is actually present as rendered data. No broader new tribunal.
The PTY also checks an unsubmitted draft survives busy interruption. Final scoped
checks follow these narrow presentation/oracle corrections.

Final narrow presentation corrections: terminal/PTY debug2/2, release2/2 and
ASan/UBSan2/2 plus terminal static analysis pass. Earlier changed engine/provider
checks and Lua diagnostics remain green; no unrelated qualification rerun needed.
Interactive slice delivered locally with default TUI and explicit --plain fallback.
Close arconaut-uaa.6 as this implementation slice, leave transition acceptance
arconaut-uaa.3 open for actual operator development. Broad integrated/Linux
qualification remains arconaut-uaa.4. This does not reinstate the earlier premature
claim that a successful demonstration alone makes Arco ready for daily development.

Operator requested stocktake and proposed next steps while preparing to test the
TUI. Current state is a demonstrated C++/Lua/OpenAI coding/context core plus the
interactive slice, not accepted sustained self-development. Full U1 continuation,
standing-worker custody, native reload/outpost refit, independent login and external
complaint sink remain unfinished. Current restart preserves context but reissues
participant/conversation/workflow identities and resets CLI configuration; custom
workflow errors can leave call linkage requiring manual repair. Proposed next:
operator-informed terminal fixes, persistent/discoverable development-session state
and tool/workflow ergonomics, measured latency, then managed CLM compaction/repair
and captured-state complaints. A substantive multi-iteration development session
with error/interrupt/restart continuation is the transition criterion. These are
discussion recommendations, not a newly adopted implementation phase.

Operator reported an error reopening Arco; requested exact command/error while
checking launcher and session startup. All probes used temporary copies of audits,
without provider requests or modification of operator sessions. Current debug
interactive-live copy opens/exits normally in 0.23s. Debug live-bootstrap startup
exceeded a 20s diagnostic limit; release copy returns external_unknown (0) in
0.43s. This establishes an unresolved recovery case in the historical bootstrap
session, not that it matches the operator error. No audit deleted, no effects
replayed, no repair attempted pending identification of the reported failure.

Operator clarified forced exit followed unexpected /exit behavior. Concrete
client fault: only /quit was recognized; unknown slash commands were sent as model
prompts. Short correction added to interactive subplan. Actual PTY /exit regression
failed before changes (child did not exit within 5s). Both clients now accept
/exit; unknown slash commands produce a local error without provider requests.
Rebuilt debug arco; terminal and actual PTY cases pass 2/2, including interruption,
reopen, plain /exit and typo rejection. Updated usage and formatted changed C++.
Recovery investigation remains tracked in arconaut-05n pending exact operator
command/error; no original session altered and no uncertain effects replayed.

Provider-only recovery correction: diagnostic executable on temporary audit copy
identified one opened provider attempt without receipt/terminal in live-bootstrap;
no unresolved exec/file attempt. Written SESSION_RECOVERY_SUBPLAN grounds the
limited rule in separate provider/local-effect admission. Startup now verifies all
unresolved operations are providers before resuming and records terminal unknown
without replay. Other and mixed operations remain recovered/blocked. Launcher
uses optimized release image (debug replay exceeded 20s, release copied recovery
plus Lua completed in 0.8s). Original audit hash unchanged; copy reopened twice.
Added direct native-journal recovery test: context preservation, unknown disposition,
old dispatch refusal, idempotent reopen, exec/write/unknown/mixed refusal without
partial settlement. Initial fixture failed io/EPERM because subdirectory used default
0755; corrected to required 0700 rather than relaxing storage. Temporary inspector
first compilation used stale default SDK; rebuilt with existing profile sysroot.
Debug/release/ASan+UBSan recovery and actual PTY pass 2/2 each; release terminal/
PTY/coding checks pass too. Focused clang-tidy for coding/main/recovery test clean.
Audit inspection now identifies unfinished operation and attempt; original-copy
inspection and later recovery pass directly. Kimi focused review run-x770rv55
is underway, not yet claimed complete. Operator-specific failure remains open
in arconaut-05n until we identify/test that session. No Git staging/commit/push.

Kimi recovery review completed exit0 in explicit session
session_f344f278-c470-44ea-bda1-3030cb96294a, preserved unchanged in papers.
Integrated material refinements: recovery binds continuation input/generation/
revision to admission/invocation/decision; Lua cannot masquerade as provider tool.
Terminal unknown observations append in one atomic batch; any post-reconcile
settlement/summary failure explicitly closes admission until reopen. Internal live
transition is memory-only and never authorizes old dispatch or a new turn before
helper success. Added unopened admission, insufficient space, mismatched input,
summary/payload and reserved Lua-call oracles. Mixed case had already been added
while reviewer read older fixture. Root validates decision plan/invocation chain
already; duplicate identity cannot silently overwrite decision as suggested.
Inspection/hash/bootstrap-copy checks are direct subprocess evidence, deliberately
not duplicated in unit tests. Fixture summary variable shadow rejected by configured
-Wshadow; renamed. Final affected debug/release/ASan+UBSan 3/3 each pass.
Strict recovery of actual bootstrap copy still succeeds; original unchanged.
Focused rereview run-6k5b8bmo underway on corrections, no new architecture gate.

Focused Kimi rereview run-6k5b8bmo completed exit0 in the same explicit session;
report preserved unchanged. It confirmed fail-closed/metadata corrections and
identified a real summary-after-settlement failure window. Removed the redundant
separate recovery summary: terminal-unknown payloads explain recovery in the same
atomic batch. Updated subplan and removed duplicate summary oracle, preserving
payload checks. This replaces a failing second mechanism rather than layering
summary-repair bookkeeping onto it. Final recovery debug/release/ASan+UBSan pass;
final bootstrap copy resumes/reopens in 1.7s total with original hash unchanged.
Focused static analysis caught optional access behind a custom check in test;
added explicit guarded access, analysis clean. Production binaries rebuilt.
Operator-specific recovery issue stays in progress; broad transition milestone
remains open. Next practical work: session configuration/identity continuity and
operator-informed model/terminal ergonomics, without another acceptance ceremony.

2026-10-03 — Session persistence and RRC

Operator authorized finishing persistence then building/testing restart/resume/
continue autodevelopment. Written RRC_SUBPLAN uses existing typed audit program
records and context append origins; no new library/outpost needed. SessionStore
persists model/effort/absolute workflow before activation, rejects invalid effort,
and restores logical actor/conversation/workflow identities (legacy migration from
latest decision, then explicit identity record). Main exposes /session and /workflow.
Restart tool stages a note; default Lua returns after current tool batch, further
provider request refused, failed/cancelled turn clears note. Main verifies linkage
and absence of unfinished admitted work before retaining restart intent and exit75.
Shell launcher waits for full old-process exit, replaces release executable with
same session, preserves plain/once modes and drops original once prompt/CLI override
arguments. ARCO_EXECUTABLE enables explicit alternative image/profile qualification.
Resume appends continue+note once using token origin, then consumes intent before
request; ordinary reopen does not consume. Process-local drafts/queue are documented
as not yet persistent. Main takes/clears restart note before saving intent to avoid
a stale request after a failed save on a subsequent non-turn command.

Actual-process check failed red on prior debug binary (restart unsupported), then
passed on new release: distinct PIDs, exactly two user items, retained settings/
identities, explicit override persistence, invalid effort refused, consumed intent
not rerun, workflow error does not restart, ordinary reopen does not auto-consume.
Native-journal SessionStore test simulates crash between injection/consumption and
proves no duplicate injection on reopen. Earlier affected release4/4, then new
release2/2 and debug5/5 pass. Added direct cancellation-after-restart oracle.

Live session context/rrc-live: Arco changed only its C++ request instructions to
explain RRC, ran release arco/coding_test build and coding CTest1/1 green, staged
restart, continued from PID9191 to9426 and confirmed source. Launcher exit0 and
ARCO_RRC_LIVE_OK captured. Direct audit inspector confirms eight provider requests,
stable actor/conversation/workflow across them, exactly one pending/consumed intent
and one context injection, and rebuilt instructions in final actual provider request.
No original session/audit altered, no Git staging/commit/push. Transition acceptance
stays open; this is mechanism evidence for RRC, not a new claim of daily readiness.

Kimi broad review run-o4pjhgjt timed out after300s (child143), no completed report
or resumable session metadata; no review-completion claim. Narrow read-only retry
run-uw1h9bof underway. Neuroses now reachable; first Linux attempt failed configure
because selected Lua5.4.8 absent. Acquired intact official archive (digest in
QUARANTINE.md), check-linux now builds pinned Lua in disposable remote workspace
without system installation; remote qualification underway. No new version adopted.

Focused independent Kimi review run-uw1h9bof completed exit0 in explicit session
session_8c3ae5db-d0ef-4ea3-8e03-46712fd8aeb2; report preserved unchanged in papers.
It verified scheduling, persisted settings, identity, quiet boundary, origin
deduplication, launcher arguments and worker lifecycle; no high-priority finding.
Accepted low setting-length cap refinement (model1024/workflow65536) and a concrete
plain-output C1-control defect: second UTF8 byte was unescaped, actual subprocess
red UnicodeDecodeError reproduced. Both bytes now escaped; actual process check
green. Provider-failure consumption recommendation is deliberately rejected: the
retained continue/note is the explicit retry basis; automatic re-pending could
reissue unknown requests. Plan wording now explicitly includes failures as well
as crashes. No additional workflow/library/approval machinery.

Final local affected debug/release/ASan+UBSan5/5 pass, including restart cancellation
and C1-output oracle. C++ focused diagnostics clean; Lua format/parse/LuaLS clean.
Neuroses selected5/5 pass in all three profiles using temporary pinned Lua source
build; cleanup succeeded. Narrow remote rerun for post-review settings/output/
cancellation refinements is underway. These are scoped Linux checks, not full U1
or broad integrated qualification. Docs describe user commands and process-local
draft limitation. Arconaut-uaa.7 will close when final remote checks complete.

Final post-review Neuroses session_store/rrc/coding3/3 pass in debug, release
and ASan+UBSan, capture context/linux/run-lajpx_e3; remote workspace cleanup
succeeded. Local final5/5 each profile and Lua/C++ diagnostics already green.
Arconaut-uaa.7 closed for the implemented persistence/RRC slice; arconaut-uaa.3
remains in progress for operator self-development acceptance, arconaut-uaa.4
remains open for broader integration. All launched reviews/checks/live provider
processes completed; no active experiment left running. No Git publication.

## 2026-10-03 — launch feature-driven Arco autodevelopment

Operator authorized a substantial feature list, occasional Kimi review/sanity
checks and autonomous implementation. Read current doctrine, project instructions,
RRC/usage/tool sources and Kimi colleague skill. Wrote docs/AUTODEV_QUEUE.md: 30
features with completion conditions, ordered first A1–A6 run and Kimi checkpoints
after pairs. Production remains C++/Lua, existing audit is retention authority,
shared services stay externally governed, mutation/publication/adoption boundaries
unchanged. Initial independent queue review and Arco launch follow.

## 2026-10-03 — A1 file range presentation

Read doctrine, usage/RRC, queue, actual tools/engine observer and GPTMe dossier
(original/view separation). Wrote docs/A1_FILE_RANGES_SUBPLAN.md. Direct range
oracle failed on previous release (corrupt), then implemented optional byte and
line fields in src/tools.cpp and model schema. Exact full file captured through
existing file.read observer; slicing is presentation only, existing full read
compatible. No second retention subsystem or imported source. Tests cover CRLF,
empty/unterminated/trailing LF, binary/NUL, beyond EOF, reversal, mixed modes,
numeric type and overflow. Release arco/tools_test/coding_test build and tools+
coding 2/2 pass; debug tools 1/1 pass. Updated usage/queue. Initial queue review
and Codex final not present at this boundary; do not wait. A1 resumed behavior
verification next, then A2, pair review and diagnostic/sanitizer/Linux batch.

Initial Kimi docs-only sanity check completed exit0/child0, explicit session
session_6f24483a-5146-4605-8293-2b33d9c52afe; unchanged report in papers. Accepted
three clarifications: omitted output retrieval via retained audit, queued inputs
restore as drafts after automatic RRC continuation with explicit submission only,
and persist existing draft/history bounds. Queue and context/autodev/queue-sanity.md
carry these into the active Arco mission. Arco launcher PID15370 is backgrounded
with session context/autodev/session and log context/autodev/output.log; it has
written A1 subplan, reproduced actual failing tools test, and started implementation.
This is a launched ongoing A1–A6 run, not a completed-feature or acceptance claim.

A1 verified after RRC via actual resumed Lua file call: line1 exact LF retained
and bytes[0,6) '# Arco'. Initial queue review now complete: inspected exact brief
match run-fd5ma0qm, actual final assistant and result exit0/child0, preserved by
operator in papers/2026-10-03-autodev-queue-kimi-review.md. All three clarifications
are valid and queue already integrates audit-only A2 retrieval, A4 restored queue
as drafts behind continuation, existing draft/history bounds; no disagreements.

A2 subplan/source implementation: output_max_bytes validates before effects and
clips only model raw-prefix presentation with counts and binary hex fallback.
CodingEngine output_ref names audited attempt; read_process_output reconstructs
matching process.output sources in retained order, not a captured RAM buffer or
replayed command. Direct prior tools budget oracle red, new tools green. Native
engine test uses actual Lua API, closes/reopens native audit, retrieves omitted
suffix, checks one marker write/nonzero exit, and retrieves timeout partial bytes.
Test setup initially failed because owned journal correctly refuses 0755 dirs;
changed fixture to 0700. Timeout is existing interrupted exception, not a returned
failure; oracle corrected to assert that and inspect audited attempt reference.
Affected debug/release/ASan+UBSan tools+coding 2/2 each pass. Preserve read bytes
before range validation so unsuccessful presentation cannot lose a completed file
read. A1/A2 review run-ti9i7fjs and Linux run-166ojusf plus rigor debug running.

A1/A2 checkpoint: initial run-ti9i7fjs timed out exit124/child143 with no final,
not reviewed. One focused retry run-gs3nzkyx completed exit0/child0 in exact session
session_8a4cb36b-b89c-4600-a13c-9f8b5e23d6b4. Inspected actual final events and saved
unchanged to papers/2026-10-03-a1-a2-kimi-review.md. No blockers. Conditional tail
gap is not real: native_process.hpp read invokes output_observer BEFORE capacity
check/pending.append; take_partial only contains already-observed bytes. Re-emitting
it would duplicate output. Chunkless known exec returns legitimate empty output;
extra counters cannot certify missing captures and add no useful oracle here.
Accepted cosmetic timeout schema spacing. Refinement about future fixture attempt
selection is not current misattribution; current fixture has exactly two execs.

Neuroses run-166ojusf affected tools/coding 2/2 each debug/release/ASan+UBSan green,
remote cleanup completed. Rigor debug full CTest24/24 pass, diagnostic gate found
two unnecessary lambda parameter copies in new test. Corrected to const refs;
focused clang-tidy tools/coding + both tests clean. Do not claim full rigor gate
passed (Lua checks after failed diagnostic not reached; Lua unchanged). Final local
release2/2 and ASan2/2 green after capture-order refinement. Final release build
and RRC next; verify bounded exec plus audit retrieval from replacement, then A3.

## 2026-10-03 — A3 serialized context/request visibility

A2 verified in replacement Lua: bounded exit7 output 'ab', omitted4, durable
read_process_output suffix 'cdef'. A3 subplan grounded in actual context/request
serialization, Lua bridge, terminal command and provider result path. Added
ContextStore::stats and /stats/arco.stats()/context_stats; preserve /context view.
Exact compact UTF-8 JSON input/view/per-item byte counts, not token estimates.
Request bytes after all overrides shown before transport, numeric allowlisted
actual usage displayed only when returned; absent usage null, scoped to process.
No authentication/extension text shown. Existing retained provider audit unchanged.

Direct scripted provider/Lua stats oracle red external_unknown on old binary;
new exact request-size/usage/extension exclusion/absent-usage cases green. Context
empty/edit/non-ASCII escaped-newline oracle corrected from shorthand JSON LF2 to
actual owned serializer's Unicode escape6: item19/input21. Existing assistant-text
checks adjusted to permit new request-size presentation, still assert suffix and
stream preview. Release arco/context_test/coding_test built; affected release2/2
and debug2/2 pass. Pair review/sanitizer/Neuroses follows A4. Next RRC verification
stats in new process, then persistent terminal UI state with PTY reopen oracle.

## 2026-10-03 — A4 bounded persistent terminal UI state

A3 verified in replacement Lua:143 entries,input477986/view485333/request482577
bytes and actual returned usage109721 input/58 output/109779 total with numeric
cached/reasoning details. No token estimate or content dump needed.
Read actual Composer, run/worker/queue and main session/RRC wiring and PTY/RRC
fixtures. Wrote A4 subplan. Appended direct PTY reopen/RRC oracle; old image failed
Ctrl-Q exit timeout. Implemented lossless bounded hex UI snapshot in locked session
ui-state.json (not context/audit/output storage). Composer draft/cursor/history
restore; pending queue becomes labeled recovered shelf, /draft N loads only,
separate Enter submits; RRC continuation is sole automatic initial work. Save on
input/queue transition and before dispatch. Ctrl-Q preserves unsent draft/pending
work; Ctrl-C deliberately clears runnable queue only. Sent prompts never restore
as runnable. History128+aggregate1MiB and queue/recovered128+aggregate1MiB; current
draft1MiB. Damage warning leaves audits alone. No worker writes UI state.

PTY first new test timeout was an oracle pipe-drain issue: child blocked writing
screen while parent wait() stopped draining master. Replaced with bounded drain+
poll, not longer sleeps. Green test exercises actual UTF8/multiline draft+cursor,
history reopen, queued command withheld across exit75/resume, continuation first,
explicit shelf load/Enter writes marker exactly once and later reopen no pending.
Native tests binary/incomplete-UTF8 state roundtrip, insertion cursor, bound
rejection preserving prior saved state, damaged parse refusal. Local release,
debug and ASan+UBSan terminal/PTY/RRC/coding/context5/5 each pass. Focused clang-tidy
eight changed TUs clean. Narrow pair Kimi run and Neuroses checkpoint running;
usage/queue updated. New dependencies/services not needed; no source imports.

A3/A4 review run-5y86stpv timeout124/child143; truncated assistant report retained
as papers/2026-10-03-a3-a4-kimi-incomplete.md, explicitly not completed review.
Bounded focused retry run-edoh7dhd completed exit0/child0 exact session
session_e86a3299-b651-4cb8-80f5-d902432b73f7; inspected final events, unchanged final
papers/2026-10-03-a3-a4-kimi-review.md. No blockers. Prior tentative /draft overwrite
finding invalid under real input: Enter returns whole text and clears composer;
'keep me/draft 1' is not a recognized command. No extra check-for-check needed.
Save-before-dispatch intentionally avoids retrying uncertain effects; crash after
saved removal/before dispatch can leave unexecuted work for explicit diagnosis,
not fabricate completion. Incomplete report's save failure refinement accepted:
warn/retain drafts, hold new dispatch on failed persistence (queue moves to shelf)
rather than abort UI. Cursor mid-UTF8 loads snap backward (review incorrectly says
forward in passing; actual code/tests confirm backward).

Direct PTY failure injection replaces ui-state target with directory to force
atomic write failure; first failed red with io because owned Error is not derived
from std::exception. Corrected UI load/save error catches; no native effects run
when pending-state save fails, explicit Enter after repair writes marker once.
Oracle then falsely matched old '[exit0]' transcript before new effect completed;
replaced that final check with bounded direct effect marker polling while draining
PTY (actual oracle, not a test-certification layer). Final PTY green includes
ordinary queued-draft reopen in addition to RRC. Latest debug/ASan5/5 and focused
terminal/tests diagnostics clean. Neuroses initial run-ij1hgjs0 five selected cases
passed all three profiles; pre-error-catch snapshot run-nsbcr9yf failed matching
save-failure red. Postfix run pending; no portable green claim for latest until done.

Postfix Neuroses run-aj8w4g1h terminal/PTY/coding/context4/4 each debug/release/
ASan+UBSan pass; remote cleanup complete. Final release arco built with latest
error handling, affected terminal/PTY/RRC/coding/context5/5 pass. Pair review final
and own refinements integrated, all experiment children done. Next RRC verify
persistent UI with replacement subprocess PTY, then A5 session discovery/A6 comfort.

## 2026-10-03 — A5 read-only local session discovery

A4 verified from replacement by actual scripts/check-terminal-pty release Arco:
paste/resize/cancel/restore plus persistent draft/history/RRC/ordinary queue/once
submission/save-failure cases pass. A5 subplan grounded in main private audit paths,
SessionStore audited settings/identity, native exclusive owner. Do not instantiate
a retained writer just for listing. Derived configuration snapshot session-info.json
written by owner startup/commands; audit remains authority, failure warning through
UI emitter. --list-sessions [ROOT] and /sessions scan selected direct child sessions,
return stable absolute path/config/status/audit-mtime activity/shell-quoted explicit
resume command. Damaged/missing snapshots visible, symlink children excluded;
nonrecursive/no global catalog/no journal recovery/locks/repair on listing.
Legacy config unavailable until ordinary reopen, explicit docs limitation.

Actual-process live-owner fixture red missing snapshot on old release. Green new
release/debug session_store+RRC2/2: concurrent listing of held session, config,
activity, path containing apostrophes, damaged sibling tolerated, missing root not
created, exact session/audit files unchanged. Native snapshot size refusal/list
status test added. Snapshot failures nonfatal, /sessions doesn't refresh even its
own snapshot. Entry directory/canonicalization use error-code paths. Release arco
rebuilt with affected tests green. A5/A6 review/portable/sanitizer batch follows A6.

## 2026-10-03 — A6 visible long activity and anchored display

A5 replacement --list-sessions context/autodev returned this actively held session,
actual model/effort/workflow snapshot, audit activity and quoted stable resume path.
A6 subplan grounded in terminal render/worker/status/scroll plus admitted operation
observation. Direct appended PTY comfort oracle failed old release missing separate
Turn/Tool timing; also exposed shifting viewport under streamed tail. Implemented
operation completion callback after retained terminal observation with named
completed/failed/stopped-unknown elapsed milliseconds. UI turn/tool timers distinct,
completion/cancel/failure labels and transcript events; main failure path signals UI.
Anchor end-relative scroll by new wrapped-line delta at same width; clamp resize,
show UpN distance and retain composer/cursor. Transcript trim now handles giant
no-newline UTF8-safe suffix with explicit notice and preserves audit untouched.
Native direct 2MiB/noLF/multibyte bounds oracles added.

PTY checks numbered prior viewport across delayed stream, >=3s turn/tool timers,
PgDn tail, typed composer across supported resize/cursor coordinate bounds and
completed/cancelled/failed outcomes. Oracle initially sampled incomplete terminal
frames: switched to last *completed* frame ending cursor-show, not last raw prefix.
Another preexisting A4 failure-injection fixture raced prior tool completion so a
new prompt was genuinely queued and correctly demoted to recovered shelf (not
composer). Restart idle fixture before injecting that save error, removing wrong
assumption rather than weakening effect oracle. Latest release affected5/5 and
ASan5/5 pass; debug PTY rerun1/1 after fixture fix plus prior other4/4 pass. Focused
six-TU diagnostics clean. Final Kimi run-423c70ta and Neuroses run-cjbu9d3p underway.

Owned boundary hardening: discovery summary must be regular lstat file before
read, so damaged FIFO/symlink metadata cannot hang/follow foreign content. Actual
live-owner fixture includes FIFO damaged entry; latest release5/5 green. No new
libraries/production Python/agents or audit retention subsystem added.

A5/A6 independent run-423c70ta completed first attempt exit0/child0 exact session
session_0dee7ba0-85ee-454b-a017-5075705e830b. Actual final inspected and unchanged
papers/2026-10-03-a5-a6-kimi-review.md. No blockers; accepted valid trim+scroll drift.
Correct end-relative scroll grows by appended wrapped lines G irrespective of
front removal T, then clamps if anchor removed; suggested G-T instead preserves
numeric index, not same content. Added spec arithmetic oracle old100/end90,
append20/trim10 => new110/end80 scroll30; no-trim/follow/clipped-anchor cases too.
Pre-trim wrapping only on oversize/scrolled paths avoids idle repeated scans.
Accepted cosmetic interruption label without disposition changes, canonical root,
explicit unavailable activity status. Leading-- root spelling documented ./ or
absolute rather than new parsing machinery.

Narrow same-session followup run-8m3vvs90 exit0/child0 final inspected, preserved
papers/2026-10-03-a5-a6-kimi-followup.md. It caught missing no-trim fallback during
concurrent edit; actual debug/ASan comfort oracle independently failed exactly same
one-line drift. Fixed caller to pass post-size when no trim occurred; existing real
PTY anchor checks and added no-trim arithmetic oracle green. Diagnostic easily-
swappable parameters on new helper corrected to a named TerminalScrollUpdate with
designated fields, not warning suppression. Six focused TUs diagnostic clean.

Neuroses initial run-cjbu9d3p5/5 each3profiles green before review refinements.
Post-review run-gkfnsn88 caught no-trim regression while edits/checks overlapped;
run-4jqh2g4x then failed a real oracle ordering issue: at narrow resized viewport,
completion status/trace pushed NEW_TAIL above live bottom before PgDn assertion.
Replace shell fixed completion sleep with explicit release-file handshake so tail
view is observed while native tool still active, then release and observe completion.
Fixture finally cancels/exits cooperatively before kill, avoiding orphaned handshake
children. Latest local release/debug/ASan5/5 pass; latest Linux handshake snapshot
running. No claim either failed Linux attempt qualified latest image.

Final A5/A6 Neuroses run-bzwigezt terminal/PTY/session_store/RRC/coding5/5 each
debug/release/ASan+UBSan green; cleanup complete. Final local optimized arco and
affected tests built, release5/5 green; latest debug/ASan5/5 and focused diagnostics
already green. All reviews/check subprocesses done. A5 complete/resumed verified;
A6 implementation complete pending actual replacement PTY verification. Bead stays
in_progress until that final verification, then close only arconaut-uaa.8, not core
milestone/acceptance. Queue and notes retain honest legacy-snapshot, capacity,
UI/crash and existing workflow/effect-recovery limits. Recommend B1 managed
compaction next, explicitly preserving originals and active call/result protocol.

## 2026-10-03 — A1–A6 completion in the replacement image

Resumed after final quiet RRC into rebuilt release. Actual replacement
scripts/check-terminal-pty build/release/arco passes all original paste/resize/
process+Lua interruption/reopen, A4 drafts/history/queued-shelf/RRC/once/savefailure,
and A6 turn/tool elapsed/anchored stream/resize composer cursor/outcome scenarios.
Queue A6 now complete; all A1–A6 achieved within stated scope. No native changes
in this final turn, so no needless rebuild/restart. Feature bead arconaut-uaa.8
closes after this verification; acceptance arconaut-uaa.3 remains in_progress,
broader integration arconaut-uaa.4 remains open, core milestone untouched.

Queue completion summary documents limits and substantive remaining work: 16MiB
collection capacity, process-local usage, UI arbitrary-crash/powerloss limits and
save/dispatch gap, nonrecursive/stale/missing legacy snapshots, codepoint/minimum-
terminal constraints. Existing arbitrary Lua-error call linkage and unfinished
file/process recovery remain defects for later units. Recommend B1 explicit managed
compaction next: this real run accumulated large context; use choice/source/revision
and protocol-safe repair, not a guessed automatic token limit or destructive edit.
All independent reviews/followup final events and child statuses inspected; failures
retained honestly. No new libraries, production Python, mutation, Git publication,
coding delegation, quarantine or unrelated edits. Beads backup follows closure.

## 2026-10-06 — managed compaction and serious campaign

Operator authorized B1 immediately with serious campaign today. Inspected current
ContextStore original/CAS/replay APIs and CodingEngine protocol/tool path; current
individual restore lacks batch protocol-order repair. Wrote focused subplan with
explicit managed choices, durable source/revision/ancestry, turn-boundary staging,
repair and direct adversarial/metamorphic/live/scale campaign. Historical completed
autodev session remains untouched. Launch fresh Arco implementation/campaign with
occasional independent Kimi code and oracle checks; no automatic policy/dependency
adoption, mutations or Git publication.

B1 source grounding completed: actual ContextStore/CodingEngine/Lua/terminal APIs,
CORE_DESIGN CLM section and official CLM source-study dossier. Concrete explicit
proposal, append-only turn settlement, immutable synthetic ancestry, chronological
batch restore and hex bounded inspection written into subplan before coding.

## 2026-10-06 — giga campaign proposal from project notes

Operator requested a proposal while managed compaction runs. Inventoried161
Markdown design/research/family/review/history notes and105 capability dossiers;
read current brief/spec/plan and relevant synthesis, workflow/standing-state/CLM/
autodroit/oracle/replacement findings, surveyed remaining headings and consequence
markers. Historical proposals and resolved review findings stay distinct from
current authority/defects. Read Rhizome rigor seed read-only and Jev tooling limits.
Used write-page writing guidance with established repository papers destination.
Saved papers/2026-10-06-giga-campaign-proposal.md: six successive development waves
culminating in integrated real-work/self-improvement campaign, suggested twelve
scenarios/three pilots and bounded initial hypotheses. Immediate recommendation
is sustained repair/audit then Lua tools/modules; RRC permits native reload/refit
to follow. Proposal only: no new implementation launched, existing compaction
mission unchanged, no new dependencies/publication/mutation authorization inferred.

## 2026-10-06 — B1 initial coherent implementation boundary

Managed store + tool/Lua/operator commands implemented. Durable native context
packets record proposal/outcome, exact input revision, settlement stage and output,
summary originals with ancestry. CAS rejects stale/malformed/overlap, safety keeps
all live user/system/developer messages and complete tool intervals. Stage retains
current open tool batch and suffix results until successful workflow completion;
failed/interrupted work cancels, RRC sees settled view. Explicit invocation snapshot
for model proposals with omitted base avoids the provider-output revision gap;
supplied base remains strict CAS. Batch restore removes edited/reordered selected
presentations then merges exact originals by capture order. Bounded hex-byte
original/index/history inspection added; generic CLM remains available.

Direct store/engine oracles pass initial debug3/3, ASan+UBSan3/3, release4/4
(including session_store). Actual native reopen additionally checks exact accepted
view/ancestry and orphan stages do not execute. Six affected TUs clang-tidy clean.
Fixed own selection/current-call omission found while studying live model tool
flow before campaign, plus broadened mission safety beyond latest user. No claim
of summary semantic accuracy, final campaign or final fleet qualification yet.
Core independent review run-tkhnw446 currently active; preserve final unchanged when
completed. Remaining: integrate consequential findings, live replacement/API test,
>=100 mixed independently-modeled transitions, scale/replay measurements, actual
model summary + distinct archive/select and deliberate omitted-fact recovery, code
task continuation after compact+RRC, campaign oracle review, coherent final Mac/Linux
snapshot. Campaign artifacts context/compaction-campaign; final paper path fixed.

Operator clarified the giga campaign should do productive coding work. Revised
proposal: first pilot assignments deliver an audit explorer, local captured-state
rageshake and Lua tool registry; later assignments build workshop waves. Harness
interventions remain separately attributable from product outcomes, with matched
task variants/fresh evaluation rather than memorized repeats. Existing managed
compaction mission remains unchanged; no concurrent implementation launched.

Core Kimi completed run-tkhnw446 wrapper0/child0 final inspected and preserved
unchanged papers/2026-10-06-compaction-core-kimi-review.md. Valid model base-gap and
staged-selection gaps had been independently found/fixed during review. Added real
scripted provider-order oracle (response append before model tool call, current
select retained plus result) and native reopen orphan stage case. Fixed nonlive
journal failure to always clear RAM workflow/pending, added explicit capture-index/
revision inspection. Finding3 proposal to whitelist append origins is not adopted:
standard turn.lua appends model tool results through generic arco.append; all store
appends are explicitly audited continuation, all full-view edits invalidate. Invalid
appended linkage must reject settlement. Updated subplan to make that distinction
unambiguous, preserving generic CLM agency. Larger inspection/recovery/model/scale
fault campaign and independent oracle review remain; feature bead stays open.

Operator requires actual Blackbird cycle including acquiring/USING literature
and refimpls; colleague roster Kimi/MiMo/separate ChatGPT/Claude. Examined live
B1 log: written plan/direct tests/Kimi review visible, but direct original paper/
reference code reading not yet evident (mostly study notes). Added concrete
operator steering and subplan/proposal correction requiring firsthand reading
and consequential design/oracle use, retrospective challenge of current choices.
Headless once run has no live inbox; clean interrupt/resume will deliver this as
actual retained user steering rather than assuming an edited file was observed.

Delivered actual steering: cooperative SIGINT to active replacement ArcoPID55854;
old launcher/driver settled with exit130, retained interruption result. Resumed
same session only after prior owner exited, with explicit operator user prompt
to read operator-steering.md and study original sources before further campaign.
Preserved original mission/launch/result. No automatic replay of interrupted effect.

Confirmed resumed Arco consumed operator steering and began firsthand source work:
pdftotext on retained CLM paper, actual CLM edit_gate/env/harness/evolve source
reads and discovery of GPTMe compaction/recovery tests visible in live log. PDF
extractor emits syntax/font warnings; reading/repair/acquisition outcome remains
for Arco to investigate, not counted as completed research. Source-use correction
is now actively received, not merely a file left for later.

Operator source-use correction read immediately; original mission read. Firsthand
CLM PDF §§3/4.1/4.2, original harness/edit/env/evolution paths and contrasting gptme
original-preserving engine/resume plus actual stale-result test, letta-code parity
test read. Concrete source consequences and B1 reconsideration recorded in
papers/2026-10-06-compaction-source-consequences.md, subplan updated before new tests.
No duplicate acquisition needed; extracted PDF warns fonts/syntax but relevant text
readable. No refimpl executed/edited. Named colleague Kimi already qualified.
Replacement actual parent is rebuilt release/arco using compaction-campaign/session;
retained previous restart tool result is scheduled:true. No effect replay attempted;
next distinct step is source-driven mixed native oracle and fault red tests.

Operator adds configurable subagent limitations, all configured provider/model
spawning permutations bounded by actual upstream capability rather than arbitrary
harness topology, plus station feed/trigger background and campaign operator-seat
modes. Recorded requirements in FOUNDATION; wrote discussion sketch separating
participant/provider/workflow/profile, configurable limits, feed admission and
UI attachment/autodroit. Added to giga proposal; current compaction mission unchanged.
No new runtime implementation, dependency, provider authentication or colleague
invocation implied. Existing Station reference remains a comparator, not our mode.

Operator adds Grok to preferred colleague roster. Updated foundation, participant/
mode sketch, giga proposal and standing steering reference; all-provider spawning
and actual adapter/auth qualification requirements unchanged.

Managed-context status audit found run stopped exit1 at2026-10-06T13:18:36Z: last
compound command hit native exec120s default. Release4/4 green, ASan coding/tools/
context passed but campaign case incomplete, diagnostics not reached. Source use
now substantive in source-consequences paper. Native independent160 transitions/
16reopens green; scale549166->225 serialized bytes with originals retained, mock
request measurement not live semantic result. Oracle review run-mz4dltlh has
substantive report but no result.json/no process, thus incomplete; leads include
request-boundary/paging oracle gaps. Resumed same session after owner exited with
explicit timeout-aware commands, integrate findings and complete live semantic/
repair/code/RRC and final Mac/Linux campaign. No automatic unknown effect replay.

Operator corrects timeout policy: tool deadline should permit reattempt/new
approach, not halt. Paused active campaign cooperatively after settled tool,
provider interruption retained; no concurrent owner edits. Wrote timeout subplan
grounded in native child/deadline/cancellation/kill-reap behavior and acquired
platform docs; added direct result + default-provider-loop different-approach oracle
with externally counted once-only prior effect. Direct red check follows.

Timeout direct red failed with interrupted in coding_test. Native deadline now
uses existing io/ETIMEDOUT; explicit cancellation remains interrupted. Exec audit
result includes timed_out=true/effect_outcome=unknown/output_ref, terminal unknown
disposition preserved, no automatic command replay. Default model request guidance
explains recovery. Real native command+default Lua/provider fixture reaches three
provider steps and different successful command, original effect counter exactlyX.
Debug coding/tools/openai3/3 and release terminal_pty/RRC/coding/tools/openai5/5
green; focused three-TU clang-tidy clean. ASan and Kimi narrow review underway.

Timeout fix ASan coding/tools/openai3/3 green, release5/5/debug3/3 and diagnostics
already green. First Kimi narrow review run-7xllqyn3 timed out180s (wrapper124/
child143), no completed report/sessionID. One narrower bounded code-only retry
prepared; no timed-out review accepted. Compaction can continue independently in
rebuilt release, valid future findings integrated by owner.

Tool-timeout Kimi bounded retry completed: run-3q18w3m5, wrapper/child0, exact
final saved unchanged in papers/2026-10-06-tool-timeout-kimi-review.md. Reviewed
all findings against complete call path. Claimed exit-status/ETIMEDOUT blocker
and throw-path disposition concern do not apply to exec: LocalTools passes &status
to Child::collect (tools.cpp220), so every completed child exit returns output
and exit_code before the throwing branch; engine then marks nonzero status
failure. Provider collect without status can throw an exit-status detail, but
provider errors always propagate and never receive exec timed_out markers.
Partial-output concern likewise does not apply: child output_observer journals
each raw chunk, operation output_ref identifies attempt for read_process_output;
existing direct timeout/reopen oracle retrieves exact PARTIAL. Spawn uses
POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP/pgroup0, confirming local group cleanup assumption.
Reviewer correctly confirms cancellation-before-deadline and cleanup-before-result.
No source modification warranted by these findings; narrow three-read review
is not a full process qualification. Local direct debug/release/ASan checks and
diagnostics are green as above. Timeout continuation bug locally complete;
compaction campaign still running, final Linux/campaign acceptance pending.

## B1 oracle resolution and timeout continuity, 2026-10-06

Incomplete Kimi run-mz4dltlh final preserved explicitly incomplete; standalone
replacement run-0yv51w07 completed wrapper0/child0, final independently inspected
unchanged papers/2026-10-06-compaction-oracle-kimi-review.md. Consequential gaps
integrated: wholly model-derived paging expectations/next/length/EOF/invalid offsets,
actual provider request before and after end-of-workflow settlement, persistent
reorder plus sparse restore, malformed entry engine rejection + actual Lua archive
repair (permanent-brick claim disproved), developer summary pinned. Completed review
followthrough adds malformed suffix settlement rejection/no view mutation, multiple
post-stage tool batches, exact rejected source recovery from bounded native history,
beyond EOF clamped-empty contract all kinds, native reopen repaired parallel group,
and bounded exact 8KiB recovery after scale reopen. Logical160 model excludes random
protocol groups; direct protocol oracle intentionally separate, scope reported.
Debug3/3 review-integrated; release4/4 and ASan+UBSan4/4 now complete, individual
explicit600s checks. Prior deadline stopped harness, not a failing test. Latest scale
release source549166->225 JSON input bytes, audit18868418->18898258; publish12.9196ms,
physical replay573.338ms, request assembly+audit+mock116.044ms request6637bytes, not
network/inference latency or tokens/cost. Retained sources exact; mock request asserted.

Operator's separately implemented timeout fix verified from replacement: read-only
sleep probe timeout1s returns io/ETIMEDOUT, timed_out true, unknown effect_outcome and
output_ref; read_process_output retrieves B1_TIMEOUT_PROBE_READONLY. Distinct new
command returns B1_DISTINCT_COMMAND_AFTER_DEADLINE, no replay. Continue core campaign,
do not edit that fix blindly; final Linux include tools/openai/cancellation/PTY/RRC.

## First actual live model compaction staged

Live expected facts/constraints predeclared in live-oracle.json before summary;
actual assistant source planted, ID retained in live-source-id.txt. Current live
model authored an explicit summary of182 closed nonmandatory entries, deliberately
omitted one source fact, kept all user/system/developer instructions and current open
tool interval. manage returned staged:true and published no view mid-workflow;
source/program/selection retained in native audit. live-before.json/input684527bytes
at fixture plant; live-stage.json captures summary/base/outcome. First live activation
at conclusion+quiet RRC next, not a mock. After resume, verify retained literals and
omission absence in actual view/request; recover by bounded original ID before
reading expected oracle. Then productive inspection revision guard red/code/green,
distinct archive/select, actual commands and final Mac/Linux remain. No final early.

## Arconaut sprite in the terminal

Operator supplied arconaut.png and requested a mildly animated harness integration.
Read PNG grid/palette without modifying asset:16x24 logical10px squares, transparent,
177/201/195 green, white. Written MASCOT_SUBPLAN; direct native terminal renderer and
existing PTY checks are references. No dependencies/image decoder/image protocol.
Half-block rendering reserves18 right columns at>=90cols/>=20rows,12rows tall;
all text wraps remaining width, original transcript height retained. Busy500ms
one-pixel bob/plume tint, idle static; overlay followed by composer cursor restore.
Narrow/short terminal hides mascot and reclaims width. Display only, no model calls.

New actual PTY presence oracle failed old release (red). Release rebuilt and first
resize oracle exposed old test's broad ESC[11; substring: now also a mascot row
address. Tightened to actual final composer cursor sequence, no product bypass.
Release terminal/PTY2/2 green with busy phase colors, hide-on-narrow resize and
existing paste/interruption/scroll/cursor/draft/RRC checks. Debug/diagnostics and
bounded Kimi review running. Supplied image stays unchanged.

Mascot debug terminal/PTY2/2 green; focused terminal TU clang-tidy and header/TU
format checks clean, rebuilt release. Kimi120s timeout124/143, no final, not reviewed.
Operator authorizes MiMo/ChatGPT fallback for persistent Kimi failure; no MiMo
adapter configured here, used separate native Codex/ChatGPT read-only CLI session
(gpt-6.1-sol medium), completed exit0; exact report retained unchanged in
papers/2026-10-06-mascot-chatgpt-review.md, raw brief/events/result under context.
No mascot-specific finding. Genuine pre-existing physical<10rows/<12cols clamp
bug recorded as separate issue with direct PTY cases; not masked by mascot tests.
Mascot feature complete, root image unchanged. No Git publication.

Operator launches new frumentarii survey of self-driven program/harness evolution.
Three explicit independent lanes: empirical methods/evaluation, evolving harnesses,
orchestration/observability. Plan in papers/frumentarii-2026-10-06/CAMPAIGN.md;
primary literature and pinned original source acquisition/study underway. Results
must distinguish actual executable improvement from oracle portfolios, task outcome
from future evolution ability, operator time from worker/provider resource usage.
Research only; no automatic adoption or experiment campaign launched by bibliography.

Compaction driver had stopped14:16UTC after actual summary publication and
restart result scheduled:true, then busy(0), so campaign not complete. Read-only
audit inspection finished exit0 (large history slow); no unfinished attempts printed.
SessionStore.restart refuses existing pending note; prior manual --once resumes
did not consume pending RRC. Resumed via explicit --resume-continue/--resume-once
to consume already-admitted restart instead of submitting another restart. This
does not replay uncertain effects. Old result preserved; new driver/child recorded.
Observe whether continuation actually starts; no startup success/completion claim.

Frumentarii survey complete: empirical8 methods, harness11 systems, orchestration8
mechanisms.20 pinned archives/18 distinct repository revisions, primary papers/HTML,
actual code/tests read; archives intact and extracted metadata stripped. Reports,
acquisition/restoration catalogs and source limitations under
papers/frumentarii-2026-10-06. Root read all lane reports, latest Rethinking v4/
METR primary pages and actual ModularRSI bundle/review fixtures. Synthesized
mechanism matrix, consequences and useful-work pilot in SYNTHESIS.md, linked shared
QUARANTINE catalog. Independent orchestration colleague reviewed synthesis: common
instrumentation across arms and predeclared/reported provider/RRC treatments needed;
both valid corrections integrated. Review preserved; no reference tests executed,
benchmark reproduction, dependency adoption or product behavior claim from research.

Operator slates B1->focused useful-work evolutionpilot->giga, then integrations/HUD
discussion. Queue updated, .14 depends on .9; survey .12 complete. Pilot deliberately
ships useful audit/complaint/Lua workflow machinery; independent finished behavior,
operator attention, latency, full resources and later improvement are distinct.
No experimental pilot started before B1. Persistent Kimi failures use configuredMiMo
or independentChatGPT; mascot already used completedChatGPT fallback. Current B1
Kimi inspection review run-yarf2yrz just completed0/0, so quota exhaustion is not
established. Live resumed compacted view verified retained literals/omission absence;
repair, usefulC++ and final qualification still pending, .9 remainsinprogress.

Operator corrects HUD and integration scope: lean optional packages for Linear,
Slack, Discord, GitHub, HF and others; HUD is thematic current events relevant to
project set (CVE/arXiv/finance), not harness status. True multiplayer is n running
Arconauts sharing development/build over network, agent-agent/human-human/human-agent
comms; n=2 grounds thought experiment, no fixed pair topology. Requirements recorded
in FOUNDATION, PARTICIPANTS_AND_MODES and integrationstudy BRIEF. No topology,
service/library/UI framework adopted. Three frumentarii explicitly reused for
primary docs/source study of current Claude Code mods, teams/network multiplayer,
and lean packages/thematic feeds. Root read official current mods overview/teams
page and official getting-started blog; community claims about abolished teams or
old enable flag must be checked against current official source/changelog.

## Live compaction continuation and inspection snapshot guard

Actual live activated summary reduced captured input684527bytes (fixture planting)
to61448bytes in post-RRC18-entry snapshot; view JSON69167bytes is a different metric.
Six independently predeclared retained literals all present; deliberately omitted
recovery-code absent before repair, recovered from567-byte bounded immutable original
and matched local declaration. ID field initially mistyped as `id`, yielding bounded
all-original page; corrected to `entry`. No false targeted-recovery claim. Capture
live-continuity.json/live-repair.json/live-after-input-bytes.json. Full provider
cost/tokens/caching not inferred, live audit before/after is not controlled timing.

Productive actual C++ task after compact+RRC: reread original CLM§3/4.1, original gptme
resume snapshot mechanism and concurrent-unlock stale test. Written inspection guard
subplan -> direct runtime red -> implementation -> debug3/3. Independent Kimi
run-yarf2yrz completed0/0 found genuine torn-history bug: rejected operations grow
history without advancing context head. Direct rejection-only runtime red reproduced;
a prior test compile typo (const Json::find) fixed before genuine red. Implemented
per-kind snapshot revision, additive context_revision, updated model help. Followup
run-ipu2afde completed0/0 independently found defect resolved, no new consequential
fault. Both unchanged final reports in papers. Debug3/3, formatted release4/4 and
ASan+UBSan4/4 green, release/arco rebuilt. No further product source edits currently
planned before final coherent Mac/Linux snapshot checks.

Distinct actual archive staged of the first closed failed read_file call/result
(two IDs in live-archive-stage.json), preserving summary+mission and all open tool
interval/suffix. Activates at workflow conclusion/RRC next; recover exact group after
resume via native managed batch restore, verify chronology/bytes and continued tools.
Then actual isolated plain /compact,/inspect tests, final Mac diagnostic/relevant
suite and Neuroses pending; .9 still in progress. No final early.

### Integration/HUD/multiplayer study consolidated

Three authorized frumentarii reports consolidated in
papers/integrations-2026-10-06/SYNTHESIS.md. Preserve lean optional C++/Lua
packages, distinguish module lifetime/reload/persistence, and keep display,
context inclusion and station work routing separately configurable. HUD means
project-relevant current events; account-free arXiv+KEV is a first discussion
candidate, not a selected full vulnerability or financial data solution.

Multiplayer targets n independent Arconauts, n=2 as the first useful-work
exercise: all human/model communication paths, immutable source/build input
identity, conflict handling, reconnect and independent refit. Claude teams,
cross-session messaging and mods were studied separately; ICE/Commonly/Agent
Room each supplies partial mechanisms, none establishes the complete target.
Root read current primary docs, actual declarations/replay/diff tests and
publication/persistence source paths. No dependency adoption or reference
execution. Catalog restoration documented in QUARANTINE.md.

The approved compaction -> evolution pilot -> giga sequence stays in place;
full integration/multiplayer implementation is not a new prerequisite.

### Multiplayer baseline clarified: P2P/E2EE

Operator selected peer-to-peer, end-to-end encrypted multiplayer, ranging from
IRC-style harness chat to optional “delve” problem/file/build sharing. Optional
model mail connects live Arco sessions. Updated foundation, participant design
and research synthesis: shared-build qualification belongs to the richer mode,
not the minimum chat capability. No transport/crypto library selected; relay/key
lifecycle design remains. Existing message-stage and context-independence rules
apply. This records design requirements, not implemented multiplayer.

### Autodroit must escape certification loops

Operator requires guards against certification doom loops. Added campaign
requirements to AUTODEV_QUEUE and pilot synthesis: direct fault/decision relevance,
reuse completed qualification, bounded scoped reviews/retries, explicit reopening
reasons, and stop/change/defer on repeated inconclusive certification. Actual
defects still block their candidate; passing affected required checks ends the
unit without consensus rituals. Use existing audit data, no meta-certifier.
These are design requirements; scheduler enforcement remains to be built.

### Branch-based candidates queued

Operator approved queuing candidate management: arconaut-uaa.14.1 under the
interstitial, dependent on managed compaction. Branch/commit history plus
experiment records; serial checkout reuse and bounded concurrent worktree
leases; busy checkout protection; retirement retains source/results/artifacts;
activation separate from archive. Added AUTODEV_QUEUE entry. No repository
branches, commits or worktrees created by this action.

### External terminal project board available

Operator requested a watchable TUI with the same records readable by colleague.
Implemented outside Arco in codex-tools/scripts/arco-board.lua and installed
arco-board; --once provides full text. Work uses live beads; Plan reads queued
feature tables; Activity uses explicitly timestamped backup events plus journal
headings. Select/paged detail, three-second refresh, normal quit cleanup verified
in direct PTY; Lua syntax/snapshot fixture checked. No dashboard runtime in Arco,
model calls, new libraries or server. arconaut-0kg complete.

## B1 live large-history fault resolved; coherent qualification

Replacement verification's Lua returned capacity before saved completion. Distinct
archive was independently verified absent; two bounded originals recovered and
compared exactly with prearchive expected entries. No uncertain manage replay.
Actual fault: inspect limit7 still materialized all history under default16MiB JSON
ceiling. Written virtual-concatenation subplan grounded in original gptme master-log
byte ranges; direct red existing64turn scale failed capacity. Per-record serialization
with bounded retained overlap, checked total arithmetic, no aggregate copy/global
JSON safety limit increase. Native packet payload concatenation independent expected
history>16MiB, exact7byte pages at0/mid/16MiB-3/tail/beyondEOF green. Existing small
independent UTF8/bounds/metadata roundtrip remains. Kimi qd_apwqg completed0/0 final
preserved unchanged; no correctness fault, O(history bytes) CPU per page and up to
one16MiB record transient allocation honestly documented. Tiny-page exhaustive
paging is expensive quadratic aggregate work; no caching claims.

Actual plain CLI /lua,/compact,/inspect campaign eight native processes: planted
predeclared UTF8 fact/mission, summarize, malformed/stale, rejection-only history
conflict, exact bounded recovery/restore chronology, distinct select/archive and
physical reopen repair. Development Ruby2.6 filter_map mismatch after first source
plant; inspected saved stdout, replaced with map+compact and resumed from first
capture without rerunning source append. All direct cases pass, no provider request.

Final coherent product snapshot: Mac debug/release/ASan+UBSan11/11 each for context,
coding,tools,compaction_campaign,openai,json,terminal,terminal_pty,rrc,session_store,
session_recovery (timeouts/cancellation included in tools/coding/PTy). Seven affected
C++ TUs clang-tidy clean. Neuroses Clang18.1.3/libstdc++13 all three profiles11/11,
raw context/linux/run-qlw6n_a_/checks.log. No concurrent source edits; source SHA256
before/after matches. Final release scale raw:549166->225bytes, audit18868418->18898258,
publish13.2805ms,replay293.827ms,assembly+audit+mock111.762ms,request6778bytes (schema
updated). No network/inference/token/cost claim. release/arco rebuilt latest.

Live two-entry batch restore now staged, activates at workflow conclusion before
quiet native RRC. After resume verify exact source bytes/order and actual large
history page+rejection-only stale guard in replacement image. Then finalize actual
paper, journal/queue/bead backup and close ONLY .9; broader acceptance stays open.

## B1 completion: actual native repair and productive replacement verified

Latest RRC actually resumed inhabited rebuilt range-reader/guard image. Restored
archived closed pair exactly equals prearchive items, call/result adjacent14/15;
all seven pinned entries match immutable originals. First probe incorrectly compared
lossless Lua JSON-number tables by identity, causing assert/external_unknown; saved
result absent, inspected outcome, used distinct read-only diagnostics and exact
encoded comparisons, no external effect replay. Current source push_json explicitly
represents JsonNumber as tagged table, explaining the harness error.

Actual live history104245469bytes, returned bounded7bytes; fresh guarded page equals
unguarded. One deliberate stale-base managed proposal rejected, preserves exact
view, grows audited history, and old history revision returns conflict. Raw
live-restore-verification.json/live-replacement-guard.json. This finishes staged
live archive/repair and productive-code continuity after multiple actual RRCs.
Final report papers/2026-10-06-compaction-campaign.md includes commands/features,
primary-source consequences, completed/incomplete reviews, all actual faults/fixes,
final Mac/Neuroses11/11 each/profile, sevenTU diagnostics, source coherence, exact
measurements/loss/recovery and limits. Full scoped B1 complete; close ONLY .9.
Broader milestone/acceptance and B2 automatic policy open; recommended next actual
work operator-sequenced source-grounded useful-work pilot, not implemented here.
No product edits during final qualification, no historical session mutation or
Git publication. Update queue/bead backup now.

### Checkpoint commits and branch pushes authorized

Operator requires regular commits and pushes including unmerged candidate
branches. Superseded assessment-era no-publication guidance in AGENTS and queue.
Current complete C++/Lua reconstruction, authorized historical Rust removal,
qualified compaction, research/design and issue backup will be preserved on
reconstruction/cpp-lua-2026-10-06 and pushed to existing origin; master unchanged.
External board committed separately in codex-tools; remote destination pending
operator response because that repository has no configured remote.

Checkpoint017e671 committed and pushed successfully to
origin/reconstruction/cpp-lua-2026-10-06 with upstream tracking; working tree
clean immediately after push. Captured archive whitespace is preserved as source
material; changed product/config/document files outside papers pass Git whitespace
checks. No ignored context/quarantine/PDF/build paths included. External board
commit c470ca8 retained locally in codex-tools; destination question pending.

### Launch useful-work evolution interstitial

Operator explicitly launches post-B1 interstitial. Fresh Arco gpt-6.1-sol medium
session at context/evolution-pilot/session with durable output/child/result
captures. .14 marked in_progress; .14.1 remains queued child. Mission covers
common audit/rageshake observability, contrastive Lua workflow, branch-based
candidates/bounded worktrees, bounded useful-work comparison and fresh transfer.
Requires actual primary source use, direct checks, occasional scoped colleagues,
quiet RRC, meaningful commit/push checkpoints and certification-loop guards.
No new libraries/services or all integrations/multiplayer prerequisites.

External board corrected in codex-tools: closed issues show closure outcome;
completed dependencies no longer imply waiting; live per-issue activity supplements
the separate historical backups. Old board process needs restart to load code.

### Useful-work interstitial unit1: common audit and advisory complaint

Whole-unit plan docs/USEFUL_WORK_INTERSTITIAL_SUBPLAN.md, .14 underway, .14.1
queued. Implemented bounded audit_inspect through model/Lua: real committed fact
metadata, Decision/Invocation/Attempt/Observation lineage, separate occurrences,
original event/source bytes, append-only prefix pages. Rageshake captures local
observation/references with effective context/program/model/identity/unsettled
attempts before separately audited bead delivery. Only constant local locators
leave for issue backups; delivery failed/unknown retained, no replay or immediate
repair obligation. External consumer sink unconfigured; no infrastructure adopted.

Direct unsupported red then independently specified binary/reopen/invalid bounds
green; actual CodingEngine timeout unknown/links; failed bd preserves complaint and
continues; successful fake bd captures argv and excludes private observation; huge
references rejected. Completed Kimi run-1czoup5q wrapper0/child0, final preserved in
papers. Minor findings integrated (reference bound/copy docs/success delivery
oracle); global count/limit validation deliberately strict. No consequential open
fault or second review. One edit-script failed before writing; unchanged green not
counted for intended followup, repaired via exact edits. Final changed-source Mac
and Neuroses debug/release/ASan audit+coding2/2 each; audit/test tidy clean.
release/arco rebuilt, local check/review programs stopped. Source checkpoint
commit/push then quiet RRC; live replacement + actual bead delivery verification
next. No B1 recertification, .14 closure or acceleration claim. Report
papers/2026-10-06-useful-work-observability.md. Next Lua contrast/experiments and
bounded branch/worktree leases, then common-instrumented matched pilot/transfer.

Unit1 a5f2ac4 pushed. Inhabited native replacement exposes actual audit prefix,
program/request/attempt lineage and exact program source. Lua failed parse from
reserved `end` key; exact lua.error original recovered, corrected ['end'] succeeds.
Real rageshake captured this useful contrast and created arconaut-pvl with only
local locators; private observation stays local. Unit1 complete, no B1 reopening.
Next small owned candidate CLI + editable Lua diagnosis/experiment workflow.

### Context-economy intervention after common instrumentation

Operator authorized monitoring/intervention and distinguished external steer
from Arco choosing leaner work itself. Common instrumentation source and actual
inhabited-bead result are pushed a5f2ac4/c0a4a22. Request grew623633 JSON bytes.
First pause guard deferred because a child existed; inspection identified only
provider curl transport, not tool work. Exact native process then received
graceful SIGINT during provider request; exit1, local provider outcome unknown,
original context/audit retained. No source changes or tool side effects replayed.

Same-session continuation brief directs actual managed-summary activation through
quiet RRC, bounded source/original reads and one continuity check, without
recertifying B1/common instrumentation. Economy should be visible/actionable
within the programmable campaign as useful-work/continuity tradeoffs; not blind
token minimization, weakened checks, dropped originals or an intrinsic preference
claim. Lean-workflow behavior belongs to the scoped Lua unit and fresh transfer
evidence, not another approval/judge platform. Audit inspection and resume
metadata/captures stay in context/evolution-pilot.

### Statistical basis for economical information gathering

Operator authorized trial and clarified that the interstitial should provide
statistical basis and retain/adapt to metrics. Added CONTEXT_ECONOMY_EXPERIMENT
and scoped subplan amendment: declared policy/task/oracle/resource manifest,
matched repeated runs, common instrumentation, task-level uncertainty, failures
in denominator, fresh transfer and explicit keep/revise/drop. No universal
utility score or attribution from model self-explanation. Candidate modifications
and adaptive reused tasks remain explicit; bounded batch cannot expand forever
to obtain significance. Live Arco is now staging compaction after lean steer;
amendment is queued in its design notes, not yet claimed read/implemented.

## 2026-10-06 — useful-work candidate/Lua source checkpoint
Implemented C++ bounded branch/checkpoint/lease tooling and Lua bounded audit,
contrast records, actual economy feedback, persistent boundary steer. Concrete
symlink-primary-alias red in disposable test fixed; Kimi consequential recovery
finding fixed with observed clean-prior reconciliation/partial-byte quarantine.
Unknown programs never replay; leader exit never certifies all checkout users
stopped. Actual two-slot concurrency + fixed overflow and serial retirement/archive
survival checked. Final Mac and Neuroses debug/release/ASan affected2/2 each;
Linux run-9ebbnvcz. Full report/review dispositions in candidate unit paper. B1 and
unit1 closed. Source archive not yet activation: release/arco built, quiet RRC and
ordinary live candidate/Lua observation next, then finite matched economy pilot.
Context-size check exposed accumulated implementation trace (367951 requestJSON);
compact at this meaningful boundary before more work, not native replay claim.

### Useful-work unit2 live activation and narrow fault correction

Actual native quiet RRC plus ordinary Lua helper load recovered exact original
source/error712/55 and made context/cost choices visible. One bounded isolated
serial candidate checkpoint7cbc088 pushed, relevant artifact retained, activation
separate from source and contrast record persisted. Live absent-parent request
write exposed missing confirmation gate: direct red then affected release Lua1/1
green; helper now refuses CLI dispatch without written=true. Failed activation
object/string schema request rejected before effect, corrected explicitly.
No native/B1 recertification. Next: boundary steer survives quiet RRC, retire
observed stopped checkout with branch/artifact survival, child closure; parent
finite paired economy pilot still pending.

### Candidate child complete; bounded economy pilot declared

Persistent operator boundary marker/direction observed again after real quiet RRC.
Actual slot retired, candidate source7cbc088 local+origin and copied artifact remain;
activation/archival separate. .14.1 scoped completion, .14 pilot active.
Pre-dispatch docs/ECONOMY_PILOT_MANIFEST.md freezes12runs (8development+4fresh
transfer), two useful families, counterbalanced paired repeats, source/task/edit
surface/independent acceptance/resource caps. Editable common Lua instrumentation
captures all-provider each-request usage (missing unavailable), bounded audit
locators,1s phase clocks and unknowns without replay; direct mock behavior checks
pass. No assignments/results/uplift yet. Next commit manifest then actual isolated
serial runs with fresh sessions and recorded artifacts, no endless significance.

### Finite pilot completed; useful products ship without speedup claim

Predeclared12runs completed63provider requests,12independently accepted artifacts.
Assignments448828input/20445output tokens cached0, native680.02s wall, batch706.58s;

Actual six mixed-range read errors recovered from originals (initial pcall-based

shows orchestration economy not solved. Direct archive works, nested summaries
inconclusive; no hidden lean success. Reports preserve these consequential limitations.
Shipped stronger Lua feedback/record tests and source-grounded recovery recipes.
Post-pilot typed line/byte helpers avoid actual errors; direct ordinary reads exact,
release4/4 and Neuroses all3profiles4/4 context/linux/run-bf7c9f7q. No native source
change or B1/unit1 recertification. Remaining: publish source/report checkpoint,
quiet replacement with persistent revised steer, final parent outcome+backup/push.

### Capacity recovery after completed interstitial pilot

Root verified d2b89d7 and candidate/useful-range-revision published. Original
interstitial session exhausted its512MiB audit after Lua completion; final
boundary settlement/replacement is not established. No pilot rerun or audit
truncation. Original session/audit remains at existing locators. Old control
metadata copied under context/evolution-pilot/capacity-control-20261006T201808Z.
External supervisor gained explicit --session selection (evotools418be2f pushed);
direct fake-native test verifies argument, child locator, exit and lock cleanup.
Fresh session-capacity-continuation launched supervisor34633, same model/medium;
actual first provider request observed and board shows supervised/running.
Handoff names source/report and unknown final settlement; urgent .14.2 native
transport retries and .14.3 sustained-history capacity handling follow, without
B1 recertification or another pilot. Parent remains active, giga not launched.

## 2026-10-06 — fresh session after audit admission exhaustion; live retries

Pilot source/report d2b89d7 and candidate/useful-range-revision already pushed;
all12 accepted, mixed results REVISE unconditional bounded-first, disclosed errors/
deadline instrumentation and unavailable supervisor totals. B1/.14.1 stay CLOSED.
Old final turn exhausted admission after Lua; successful boundary settlement/quiet
replacement NOT established. Old audit left untouched (bounded stat536870704 vs
configured536870912;208bytes headroom), old locators valid. This is a fresh namespace,
not replay. Parent .14 notes corrected; active urgent P0 .14.2/.14.3, giga not launched.

Read current provider/session/journal sources and acquired Codex retry patterns;
short written docs/PROVIDER_RESILIENCE_SUBPLAN.md before implementation. Retries
first since extra attempts consume audit and must propagate recording failure.
Native request-local bounded retry policy now retains separate admitted unknown
attempts/raw chunks, frozen request/group/ordinal, resets preview, never repeats
Lua/tools; visible exponential backoff with25ms cancellation. Curl errors typed
separately from errno; error enum appended and retained bounds updated. Independent
ChatGPT review found auth RPC timeout wrongly eligible under generic ioETIMEDOUT;
fixed HTTP Child deadline labeling at source, auth stays permanent local error.
Kimi timeout/Claude auth failure produced no reviews; no invented approval.
Direct partial/recovery/no double dispatch, exhaustion, permanent/classification,
invalid policy, capped nonzero waits and before/during wait cancellation checked.
Native fake curl92/HTTP deadline retain partial bytes. Actual review costs retained,
not a lean-effect claim. Report papers/2026-10-06-live-provider-retries.md.

Affected Mac debug/release4/4, ASan initial4/4 plus final coding/auth2/2; Linux all
three profiles initial4/4 plus changed coding/auth2/2 each. Initial Linux wrapper
120s deadline during ASan: inspected retained output/stopped users, continued only
remaining stopped build, not repeated uncertain effects. No full-suite/B1 recital.
Release/arco built. Next: source checkpoint+backup/push then actual quiet native RRC
and ordinary activation evidence; .14.2 remains in_progress until that observation.
.14.3 remains open: measure history growth/replay, visible headroom and explicit
successor lineage; no blind cap increase or old audit continuity claim.

## 2026-10-06 — retries activated; measured history headroom slice

87e06e6 pushed reconstruction and candidate/live-provider-retries; actual quiet
native replacement continued (PID39590/new generation ordinary request raw
retry_group+ordinal observed, paper activation follow-up). .14.2 CLOSED, not a
claim of spontaneous live outage recovery or settlement of the old namespace.
Parent remains active; .14.3 in_progress. Old audit remains536870704bytes, untouched.

Measured bounded old/fresh frame census and isolated native8/32MiB copied-prefix
replay before capacity design. docs/HISTORY_CAPACITY_SUBPLAN.md holds actual numbers,
source consequences and Codex explicit logical-fork/physical-base pattern. Context
snapshots and triple semantic operation request bodies dominate byte growth, not
SSE envelopes alone. Per-batch Snapshot copies and ContextStore full history mean
cap increase/linked root chain would worsen replay/memory without fixing the seam.
No full512MiB recovery benchmark, rate extrapolation or significance claim.

Implemented first native visibility slice: physical observation/optional errors,
indexed-data-record counts, state, saturating byte/record headroom; prefix_end
acknowledged/live or staged/recovery. Overlapping restage indexes count once.
Lua/context_stats audit object and pre-provider <=25percent remaining warning;
existing offline --audit-last prints headroom. Observation, NOT admission permission
or handoff reserve. Direct extent failure, overflow unindexed tail, nonlive restage,
record/byte thresholds, model stats and actual small-budget warning tests passed.
Fixture-cap assertion and mechanical rename compile error fixed, not relaxed code.
Mac/Linux three profiles affected4/4 then final2/2; copied-prefix CLI smoke actual
--audit-last (initial nonexistent --inspect rejected). Release/arco built.

Next native gauge checkpoint+backup/push and actual quiet RRC. .14.3 remains active:
reserved settlement allowance before workflow admission, bounded output/stream
handling and explicit successor session lineage/context-selection/old-original
inspection remain. No cap increase, truncation, moving originals or unknown replay.
Managed summary now includes opaque reasoning as well as complete old tool groups;
first summary had left reasoning presentations, causing avoidable growth. Originals
remain retained, not policy-efficacy claim. No B1/pilot recertification/giga.

## 2026-10-06 — headroom activated; declared successor seed implemented

72d7116 pushed reconstruction/candidate/history-headroom; actual quiet RRC continued.
context_stats.audit fresh journal7d62dd99e41e86aafbafb29cb3a3014b reports
237635772extent/299235140remaining bytes,35338indexed records; gauges activated.
Old namespace still untouched536870704bytes, no old boundary settlement established.

Chose explicit successor destination before reservation so a stop has a usable
exit. Written subplan before editing; --seed-session bounded JSON validates before
fresh destination creation. ContextStore.seed_successor requires empty live audit,
records selected context/new originals and declared source lineage/order mapping in
one context packet. Fresh identities, no inherited admissions, no source file access,
verification, replay or settlement claim. Author owns instruction/context selection.

Independent ChatGPT separate native one-request read-only workflow found missing
message/tool required fields and invalid role/type accepted: fixed and direct
negative oracles added. Paper records actual capture/scope, not approval rhetoric.
Initial test single-fact assumption omitted issuer reservation, corrected;128byte
fixture failed journal minimum,512byte fixture establishes capacity refusal without
context publication (allocator facts may remain). Header typo and broad schema
replacement compile failures corrected; unrelated protocol_complete restored.
Mac/Linux three profiles affected4/4 then final changed2/2 each. CLI smoke fresh seed
+quit no provider, existing audit unchanged on refusal, invalid seed creates no dir.
No repeated full suite/B1/pilot campaigns. Release/arco built; next backup/checkpoint
push and actual native quiet replacement. .14.3 remains active: reserved admission/
settlement and output bounds, live handoff, honest export/old-entry resolution remain.
This is NOT a sustained-capacity fix closure. Native caps unchanged, no giga.

Working-context maintenance: two large Lua managed proposals returned
external_unknown; no successful compaction is claimed or blindly replayed. A
distinct minimal proposal under pcall returned staged for one old summary, proving
no pending overlap from those failures. That small replacement remains staged until
this workflow succeeds; it is not evidence of useful large compaction. Remaining
large presentations need direct diagnosis/compaction after native activation; raw
originals stay retained. Fresh audit observed301708783bytes,235162129headroom before
these diagnostics (not a growth-rate claim). Capacity scope remains urgent.

## 2026-10-06 — successor native activation; normal context boundary

10a8de4 pushed and actual quiet replacement continued, PID47430 start17:15:26 after
binary17:08:12 build; ordinary provider resume works. .14.3 remains active. Large
managed context proposal on this continuation under pcall returned staged (unlike
prior two failed proposals). Success/publication waits for ordinary workflow end;
do not claim it already compacted or rerun failed effects. No native change this
continuation, hence no ceremonial RRC. Finish ordinary workflow so the large source/
check/opaque-reasoning presentations can leave the working view while originals stay.

Read actual write/admission/dispatch, source and child capture and context cancellation
seams. docs/CAPACITY_SETTLEMENT_SUBPLAN.md records consequences: exact frame costs,
triple input admissions, receipt after callback, process16MiB capture/callback unwind,
full context and pending proposal maintenance, nested outstanding attempts. A small
constant margin/request-only guard is inadequate. Next implementation owns normal
write floor and bounded protected settlement at retained write seam, with prospective
context requirement and unknown partial overflow handling; no cap increase. Current
seed/headroom do not solve sustained exhaustion, and live handoff/old resolver remain.

## 2026-10-06 — README for reconstruction promotion

Operator requests a substantial README with promotion to master after the current
capacity unit. Root owns this documentation unit; Arco continues .14.3 and has
been told not to edit README or promote/delete branches itself. Plan: replace
accumulated status fragments with purpose, runnable entry points, architecture,
CLM/audit/programmability, actual self-development, measured evolution, limits,
future integrations/multiplayer and source/research map. Ground commands and
claims in current source, USING_ARCO, tooling and actual campaign reports; mark
unfinished contracts explicitly. Verify local links and command names; no product
retesting for a prose change. Promotion waits for actual capacity completion.

README replaced with3700word guide, operator image, actual build/launch and Lua
interfaces, doctrine/CLM/audit/RRC/evolution/results, integration and multiplayer
direction, source map and reconstruction history. Thirty-two link targets checked
(local existence, external links not network-revalidated), fenced blocks balanced,
diff whitespace clean. Commands checked against operating guide and current source;
no product tests for prose. Promotion task arconaut-5x7 depends on .14.3 and includes
status refresh and preservation of candidate identities before redundant retirement.
Root resumed capacity implementation supervisor49116 after prior successful workflow
boundary; new request retains the session and explicitly reserves README to root.

## 2026-10-06 — native protected settlement credit checkpoint (.14.3)

Read current AGENTS/BLACKBIRD/operator steer and CAPACITY_SETTLEMENT_SUBPLAN before
editing. README, promotion and redundant branch retirement belong to Root; did not
edit README or merge/delete branches. Implemented the native retained-owner credit
primitive, not a guessed workflow reserve: nonnested RAII byte+physical-record floor
on normal append paths, receipt/terminal-only exact acknowledged spending, dispatch
receipt routing, unchanged pending/poisoned semantics on uncertain writes. Existing
originals/caps unchanged. Scope is volatile/caller-sized, owner must outlive it.

Direct simulation forces byte vs record normal-source exhaustion inside actual
dispatch, retains earlier originals, settles receipt/unknown terminal, no second
adapter call; preopen refusal, issuer/diagnostic floor, nested callback grant refusal,
undersized terminal/receipt, extent/allocation grant failures, partialwrite+syncunknown.
Initial optional CHECK compile mistake and incorrect no-provisional-receipt oracle
fixed; uncertain RAM is allowed, committed receipt absent. Independent ChatGPT
review8259input2277output62465ms no demonstrated accounting/publication defect;
correct duplicate-contract ambiguity clarified/tested (submit dedup, append physical).

known missing-base rejection, only applies normal boundary. Root owns README and
promotion/branch retirement; did not edit README, merge/delete/promote. bd backup.

## Second physical-capacity stop; root restores focused workflow work

After fb2b5a5 source/tests/report were pushed, final provider completed but capacity
refusal ended workflow; final managed publication/atomic RRC not established.
Original audits remain untouched at both existing namespaces. Actual output shows
provider_transport28 followed by native retry2 and accepted response, a real
transport recovery observation (not retrospective failed-attempt success).
Root supplied explicitly authored fresh handoff, not imported or verified context,
under session-workflow-protection. Prior control metadata archived, supervisor
restarted. Direction prioritizes integrated workflow protection, early headroom
action and useful outcomes over additional isolated primitives or certification.
No pilot/B1 rerun, cap increase, old-effect replay, promotion or giga.

## Backstop recovery inquiry and operating design

Operator requests stuck/quiescent step-back, assessment, pivot and continued useful
work. Root studied actual session recovery/native Child/external supervisor seams,
acquired auto-harness briefing+recovery and agentchat lifecycle sources, and primary
Crash-Only2003/Microreboot2004 papers (PDFs ignored under papers/recovery).
Concrete consequence: independent small recovery conversation/audit, native-confirmed
local quiescence separate from unknown remote/effect outcomes, selected explicit
lineage and changed next action, finite outcome-driven pivots. Current leader exit
and supervisor text parsing do not establish required quiescence. No implementation
or actual backstop recovery claim; .14.3 integrated workflow source remains with
Arco, unmodified by this inquiry. Proposed docs/BACKSTOP_RECOVERY.md and source
study saved; local links checked. arconaut-scs consumes .14.3, no extra promotion
gate. Native provider_transport/legacy externalclassifier mismatch also recorded
for bridge integration; not changed on a live supervisor by guesswork.

## Operator correction: hardening bounded to two layers

Operator explicitly rejects hours of recursive certification: layer1 remediation
tasks/fix; layer2 recheck/fix; never layer3. Root interrupted verified provider-only
boundary (native8201 had curl child, no local tool), allowing clean cancellation
before injecting steer. Active capacity source retained, not reverted.
BOUNDED_HARDENING bounds remaining unit to two actual review defects (physical
payload/batch feasibility and longer interrupted-linkage reserve), existing affected
oracles and one recheck.30min remediation+15min recheck includes waiting; no silent
reset. Automatic backstop/targeted old resolver deferred outside promotion scope.
AGENTS/queue updated; default native provider instruction adds the two-layer rule,
with no new checker/certifier. Source policy staged separately from Arco's active
implementation; runtime activation awaits rebuilt image. No tests for prompt prose;
diff whitespace and exact staged scope checked. Unsafe candidate remains inactive
at bound, never correctness-by-expired-budget.

## Caves of Qud sprite attribution

Operator identifies supplied arconaut sprite as Caves of Qud and requests prominent
near-top credit plus attribution file and purchase recommendation. Official press
kit verifies developer Freehold Games, tile art Sam Wilson, co-creators Jason
Grinblat/Brian Bucklew; individual tile authorship not independently verified.
ATTRIBUTION.md names exact local asset/terminal adaptation and published credits,
links official source and Steam/itch purchase pages. README credit follows opening
purpose paragraphs, before current implementation introduction. Local targets and
whitespace checked; no product tests for prose. Bounded capacity campaign continues
with two-layer instruction; no extra certification work from this attribution.

## Master promoted; remaining hardening is backlog

Operator explicitly directs integration now and accepts remaining work as backlog.
Fetched remote; origin/master76ddf00 ancestor with no divergence. Non-force
fast-forward pushed master to fa2d10a (41commits), verified exact remote master and
reconstruction tips. Local inactive master ref advanced without checkout; Arco's
dirty integrated-capacity source and running session remain intact. README and Qud
attribution included. Removed capacity dependency from promotion task and closed
actual promotion; branch cleanup separately arconaut-suv, preserving all refs.
Original .14 pilot scope closed delivered; .14.3/scs retained priority2 backlog,
current finite candidate allowance unchanged. No claim unfinished capacity fixes
were accepted, no new assurance gate before giga.

## GitHub language statistics reflect documentation bytes

Operator observed77percent HTML after master promotion. Tracked HTML totals
3981640bytes: capabilities/index.html2036078 and saved Godot docs1304147 dominate,
versus929407bytes .cpp/.hpp. GitHub Linguist counts detectable source by size,
including these research pages. Official Linguist override docs confirm recursive
linguist-documentation excludes paths from stats without hiding diffs. Added
.gitattributes for papers/docs/bead backups; native sources remain unspecified.
Direct git check-attr verifies classifications. No runtime change or product
checks; exact updated GitHub percentages await server-side recalculation.

## Milestone-one issue corrected to done

Operator confirms arconaut-uaa.3 is complete. Its open state came from stale
2026-10-02 transition/usability notes despite subsequent sustained self-development.
Replaced current notes, closed issue on actual operator acceptance, updated README
and implementation-plan status. No new review/test gate; remaining features and
full-core acceptance stay in separate issues. Backup/source publication follow.

## Hardening shortened to25minutes total; giga strategy begins

Operator cuts allowance to25m. Same03:28:55UTC start, no reset; remediation
boundary03:43:55 and total03:53:55. Updated bound file/docs and bead comment.
Independent development-only deadline timer13751 checks this supervisor11311
and lineage, stops retries via pause file and sends normal native SIGINT at bound
only to enrolled native Arco; does not claim descendant quiescence or kill shared
services. Exits if campaign already ended/changed. Python syntax checked, actual
watching state retained; not a production runtime feature or safety certification.
Remaining unsafe source stays candidate/backlog. Strategy discussion for giga
centers programmable tools/workflows, heterogeneous colleagues and sustained
triggered work, then optional integration/feed/multiplayer deliverables. No giga
launch or new dependency selected during discussion.

## 2026-10-07 — integrated workflow capacity stop, bounded hardening

Fresh context explicitly root-authored after two physical stops; old audits unchanged,
no imported settlement or replay. Source-grounded refinement before implementation
in CAPACITY_SETTLEMENT_SUBPLAN. Turn-owned dynamic floor covers old+prospective context,
actual pending candidate/call IDs, bounded active nesting/errors/issuer/source writes.
Private maintenance seam spends held credits, never dispatches new work. Physical caps
unchanged. Capacity sticky even through Lua pcall; streaming/process refusal aborts,
retains earlier committed fragments, records omitted received bytes/unknown terminals,
cancels management, closes call/output linkage. Bounded Lua diagnostics report loss.
Normal large successful terminals stay normal writes with bounded overflow fallback.

Direct actual-engine oracles: byte/record streamed refusal, nested Lua+pending cancel,
process file effect + partial output + responsive child cleanup + unknown + linkage,
16 admitted nested terminals, refused oversized prospective mutation, tight physical
profiles refusing prospective open-call publication/file effect, 2000-call interruption
with ordinary room consumed to protected floor. Existing atomic-admission test now
adjusts the turn-owned floor rather than illegally nesting an external scope; journal
primitive behavior unchanged. Early-warning fixture now expects pre-dispatch refusal,
not provider success when its request plus protected floor cannot fit.

First integrated coding GREEN after compile-shadow/stale-test and interrupted-string
compatibility mistakes fixed; no behavioral-red claim for those. Independent Kimi
transport failed before review. One ChatGPT review found physical packet limits and
longer interruption modeling. Payload boundary first RED committed call/file effect;
tight corrected fixtures GREEN. Invalid batch fixture (payload > batch-88) was not a
behavioral red. Exact encoded packet/framing+issuer preflight and shared longer stop
representation fix both. Old longest-dummy-ID padding means no actual under-reserve
trace claimed for wording mismatch. Layer2 one scoped ChatGPT recheck: native budget
exceptions precede refresh-only sticky catch. Stronger pcall oracle passed BEFORE
repair via existing Runtime::failed; no reproduced Lua escape. Centralized catch still
strengthened native ownership. No third review, consensus or unchanged-host rerun.

Mac initial coding/context/retained_state3/3 all3 profiles; final changed coding1/1 all3
passed. Linux initial same3/3 all3 run-32bcglod and physical-fix coding1/1 all3
run-bxpj48ls passed; final native-owner/pcall coding run pending at this checkpoint.
release/arco built final including root-authored default-instruction policy. Native
activation still pending, no completion claim yet. B1/pilot/fullsuite not rerun.
Source/report contain no private provider/audit content. Existing explicit successor
suffices scoped continuation; automatic backstop/old resolver separately queued per
ROOT, not promotion blockers. Root owns README/merge/promotion/retirement. bd backup.

Final changed native-owner/pcall Linux coding1/1 all3 passed run-6vzxt08r,
completed03:42:36Z, after previous run-bxpj48ls finished. Final Mac coding1/1 all3
also green. No third review or unchanged context/retained primitive rerun.
19a067e source pushed. Main managed compaction132 completed tool entries is STAGED
until current normal boundary; full originals remain, no physical-byte reclaim.
release/arco built23:37:51-0400 (=03:37:51Z) with final native/policy changes.
One native replacement next; activation requires observing resumed process/request,
not inferred from binary build or staged proposal. ROOT's shortened disk allowance
25min total ends03:53:55Z; remediation/recheck complete inside it. bd backup done.

Activation observed03:43:55Z: main PID14481, start03:43:10Z, binary03:37:51Z;
ordinary resumed accepted provider/tool response, provider usage available in new
process. Live ContextStore view contains published managed summary exactly once;
132-entry proposal is no longer merely staged. Physical extent161543993 bytes of
unchanged536870912 at observation; no physical reclamation claimed. Working view
was92 entries225985 serialized bytes at that check (includes pinned instructions).

Close .14.3 ONLY under ROOT's scoped capacity-unit acceptance. Root-authored fresh
session-workflow-protection remains a working continuation, NOT a verified/imported
predecessor settlement. Prior two exhausted audits stay untouched; their final
unknown boundaries are not retroactively established. Existing declared seed path
and early warning suffice this scoped continuation; unattended assess/pivot backstop
arconaut-scs and targeted predecessor-original resolver remain separately queued.
Automatic physical rollover, full old-byte resolution/replay-cost optimization and
filesystem-unavailable settlement are NOT delivered by this unit. No more reviewer,
host recheck or native replacement; complete inside shortened25min bound. Root owns
README/master promotion/retirement and launch of giga; none performed here.

## Giga approved and first recovery unit prepared

Operator agrees to ordered delivery waves: recovery/continuity, Lua programmability,
heterogeneous colleagues then orchestration/station/integrations/two peers. Scoped
capacity unit completed03:45:33 inside25min (actual activation and final affected
checks recorded), clean3041163 source tree. Root reads actual disposition and accepts
that scope without another review/profile run. GIGA_CAMPAIGN short execution brief
sets whole conceptual units, predeclared allowances, hardening25min/two layers,
useful real-work outcomes and prompt accepted-unit master integration. Epic7iy/
child units created; existing scs reparented as first backstop unit. Research and
library/provider decisions stay real, blocked units do not hold completed work.
README capacity status refreshed. Prepare fresh explicit working mission, preserving
old namespaces and unknown boundaries; no historical effect replay or seed claim.

Giga controller16550 launched03:54:14UTC, first unit arconaut-scs in explicit fresh
session-arconaut-scs, supervisor16551. Actual provider request observed and board
shows giga-campaign supervised/running. Finite ten-unit queue, at most four normal
boundary continuations per same unit,90min whole-unit deadline without reset.
Model working intent controls next normal turn; exit0 alone is not acceptance.
Nontransient native/unknown failure or blocked dirty candidate remains visible,
not auto-replayed/reset. Native qualified backstop still first implementation.
Temporary controller under ignored context uses development Python only; no
production Python introduced. Two-layer25min hardening carried in native prompt
and campaign brief, not a semantic certifier. Accepted unit master integration
authorized directly, no Root approval bottleneck. Existing source/reports read
instead of another scoped-capacity review/test run. External evotools e0fa941
aligns typed provider_transport and giga-board metadata; direct fake92 eventual
success/untypedio92 refusal and Lua syntax passed, actual board displays new run.
Queue creation first command produced G2a before JSON parsing failed (missing
--json); resumed by existing-title lookup, no duplicated tasks or missing intent.
All nine later units now tracked; no source adoption/mutants/extra gate.

## Two actual Arco implementation lanes

Operator asks for parallel Arco instances. Separate whole invariants: primary G1
recovery/process lifetime and isolated G5 heterogeneous colleagues. Existing
candidate manager initialized with ONE extra active slot at accepted8c5fcc3;
candidate/giga-colleagues runs under held lease, own local workflow/session and
immutable copy of accepted native executable. No new dependencies or model ceiling.
G5 launched04:24:51UTC (runner22229/supervisor22235/native22248), actual provider
completion and colleague.hpp source write observed.55min lane deadline05:19:51,
outer manager60min; hardening25min/two layers inside allowance. Candidate may
commit/push, Root alone integrates after all checkout users stop. Pool checkpoint
from inside held lease prohibited. No timeout/leader-exit quiescence fiction.

Primary G1 had stopped04:05 on external_unknown(0), retaining partial source. Root
preserves original audit and resumes04:27 in explicitly authored fresh working
context, not a claimed verified successor seed or uncertain-action replay. Original
03:54:14 start/05:24:14 deadline preserved across controller restart; per-unit
bounds now persist. Primary queue excludes G5, avoiding duplicate implementation.
Controller22838/supervisor22841. Partial G1 source remains unaccepted/unstaged.
Parallel ownership and integration rules in docs/GIGA_PARALLELISM.md. Canonical
beads stay primary, separate worktree does not initialize another database.

## G1 cooperative backstop candidate and actual useful pivot

Root-authored interrupted-unit continuation preserved original03:54:14/05:24:14
allowance and old audit namespace. Read-only physical tail observed commit22663 /
end102134397 with lua.error; no semantic settlement inferred. Candidate c58485b
pushed explicitly scoped G1 sources/docs/report, no G5 checkout changes. Native
same-lifetime failure ticket/custody, fresh independent assessment, explicit selected
Lua file action, changed-artifact oracle, alias-protected predecessor tree, no replay,
explicit pause and two attempts/two-minute bound implemented. Crash/reopen/arbitrary
exec containment remains unavailable, not inferred from parent exit or freed lease.

Hardening two layers only, conservative10minutes prior +15remaining ending04:46UTC.
Mac affected rrc/backstop/coding passed. Linux run-3lcgq8vh failed collect argument;

shared-provider cancellation closure lifetime fixed, direct Mac backstop passed;
final narrow Linux fix check run-8a3_ybjx still running at04:39. No third assurance.
First actual model recovery hit missing-destination read and exhausted two pivots,
retained blocked unchanged (usage3879+8656 total tokens). Independent existing-draft
transformation after direct inspection failed its source workflow, then fresh model
selected/read actual source+draft and delivered useful BACKSTOP_OPERATING.md pivot1
(usage3241 total tokens). No replay or reset of the old incident; costs unavailable.
Release built04:38:13UTC, candidate not accepted/activated yet. Same-unit RRC next,
observe actual resumed native process, finish pending fix check inside bound, then
close bead and checked non-force fast-forward master. Root owns parallel journal
publication; this source candidate did not stage journal/parallel docs/backups.

G1 final affected callback-fix Linux run-8a3_ybjx narrow backstop debug/release/
ASan+UBSan passed, observed04:41:49UTC. Actual release activation observed04:41:05:
PID26902 start04:40:14, release build04:38:13 (990712bytes), successful provider
response in resumed same Root-authored recovery session. No original effect settled
by that observation. Hardening ended inside conservative10prior+15remaining bound;
no third review/check layer. arconaut-scs closed for this cooperative scope, bd
backup performed. Giga queue note marks G1 delivered and G2 policy next, G5 remains
independent lane. Source publication uses checked non-force master fast-forward;
Root's dirty parallel journal/backups remain excluded from unit source commit.

G1 publication complete04:43UTC: source c58485b and final-outcome note b052a49
pushed candidate then checked non-force fast-forward master. Initial branch switch
refused overwriting dirty Root journal/backups; preserved them, advanced inactive
local master with non-force local fetch (ancestor check), switched identical tree,
pushed650db43..b052a49. Remote master b052a4936f0ae1031499387552314ef962deb469
observed. Root journal/backups still dirty, deliberately outside scoped source
commits. scs closed/accepted cooperative slice; next primary G2 policy in fresh
Root-authored context. No later-unit code or repeated qualification here.

## TUI chat-shell and management continuation (2026-10-07)

Management imported Codex context, observed core initially live then external_unknown; retained prior session/remote uncertainty and resumed G2 in fresh Root-authored context with original06:13:47 unit and05:14 hardening deadlines. No repeated Linux matrix or stopped colleague access retry. UI candidate 76c401613bad81e510c23a118edd6891f220575f owns terminal discovery/local controls only; completion red-to-green, actual busy PTY help/queue/stop and existing draft/paste/resize/restart oracles passed; single recheck fixed exact /draft precedence. Separate release build/ui-shell used. Source candidate publication is not native activation; see papers/2026-10-07-tui-chat-shell.md. Core dirty changes left outside UI candidate.

TUI source69a483a integrated onto accepted core8a0e959 and pushed master05:10UTC. Actual management native restart observed PID40412 start05:09:05, executable built05:07:48; resumed provider/tool conversation successful. arconaut-n64 closed and bd backup done. Core controller continues arconaut-7iy.2 workflow continuity; colleague access blockage unchanged. UI direct checks remain settled; no further assurance pass. Next UX discussion: composer first, then navigable palette and conversation readability.

## Adopted chat ergonomics baseline and composer slice

Operator says chat-first/tools-secondary UX is the baseline. docs/CHAT_UX.md captures it and exact editing semantics. UI unit began05:12:29UTC,35min whole allowance and<=10min hardening, two layers only. 932ca08 pushed master with logical-line vertical navigation/sticky terminal-cell column, explicit cursor-preserving history, line/draft/word movement and bounded kill/yank. Direct red before code; affected terminal/PTY passed; one recheck fixed transient restore kill-buffer retention, direct boundary cases and actual edited/persisted Unicode draft passed. Old PTY multiline-history assumption intentionally changed to CtrlP/N. Core workflow continuity source remains separate dirty owner. Build/ui-shell used for affected checks; main compiled activation pending core scoped qualification/rebuild, not inferred from source commit. arconaut-cy3 tracks activation; bd backup done. Wrapped rows/adaptive composer/external editor and palette/readability remain next separate whole slices, not completion claims.

Composer release built05:20:50UTC at build/release/arco (1011601bytes), after owned terminal/PTY checks. Concurrent workflow-repair final affected debug/release/ASan checks finished05:22:24UTC; no source changes were staged into the UI source commit. Management RRC may now activate this build; actual resumed native observation and arconaut-cy3 closure remain next. Source/debug claims stay distinct from activation. No third assurance pass.

## G2b explicit failed-custom-Lua protocol repair (2026-10-07)

Unit7iy.2 start05:09:25/deadline06:39:25UTC unchanged. Source-grounded native
context_repair uses strict base, workflow-start unanswered-call set, full linkage
validation and audited unknown/no-replay placeholders. It preserves existing
results/originals, refuses live owned Child/current-workflow calls, never asserts
general-exec or remote-effect quiescence and leaves cancellation/startup gates
unchanged. CLM retained-original and recovery no-transparent-retry consequences
recorded in papers/2026-10-07-workflow-repair-delivery.md. Focused red -> green
Mac release and Linux debug/release/ASan+UBSan workflow_repair passed. Two-layer
hardening05:14:30..05:22:24UTC, ended within25min; no third pass/old campaign rerun.
Interrupted background Linux driver was inspected, then same remote snapshot's
narrow target completed, not blindly rerun or labelled a result.

Actual custom workflow timeout (marker written, effect unknown) -> deliberate Lua
failure -> explicit repaired2 -> useful OpenAI model-authored operating checklist,
original audit context/giga-campaign/g2b/actual preserved. Allowed reopen confirmed
unknown placeholders.23301+1380=24681 tokens, costs unavailable; eight mixed-range
read rejections truthfully retained in guide, separate ergonomics bug arconaut-k48.
Initial scoped executable excluded dirty UI; Root subsequently accepted UI through
932ca08, final replacement includes accepted baseline. Native RRC observation,
bead closure and checked non-force master integration next; candidate != accepted.

Composer actual management activation observed PID47847 start05:23:35UTC, after own05:20:50 release build; successful resumed provider/tool conversation. Source932ca08 already onmaster, arconaut-cy3 closed and bd backup updated. Core workflow-repair773c46f separately published candidate, same-unit replacement observed PID48458 start05:25:11 after05:24:17 scoped build; core acceptance/promotion remains its continuation responsibility. UI checks remain settled, no third assurance. Baseline chat-first/tools-secondary UX adopted; next independent proposed slice external editor, then command palette.

G2b actual same-session RRC observed05:26:57UTC: PID48458 start05:25:11,

Root separately appended accepted composer note0449a17; its work preserved.
Outcome report/queue now name acceptance and remaining effect/reader limitations.
Prepare non-force publication with fresh remote/master ancestor check; G3 next
fresh root working context, no later unit implementation in this session.

G2b publication complete05:28:28UTC: candidate source773c46f and actual-activation/
acceptance note3971871 pushed candidate, then fresh ancestor check and checked
non-force local/remote master fast-forward932ca08..3971871. Actual remote master
397187116858ccf2df3d0ea0bdd1eda5928e798a observed; working tree clean. Original
failed-session paths and unknown exec effects remain preserved. Final working intent
accepted for arconaut-7iy.2; controller may start G3 in its new root-authored context.

## G3 live Lua-defined tools candidate (2026-10-07)

Unit7iy.3 start05:29:09/deadline06:59:09UTC unchanged. Source-grounded small
session registry stages schema+Lua function body through ordinary tool_define /
arco.define_tool, publishes only successful workflow boundary, exposes to later
requests, and invokes through retained operation/native-effect paths. Native names
protected; invalid source/schema preserves effective configuration; failure/pause
cancels pending. Hardening05:33:10..before05:44UTC, layers1+2 completed/no third.
Collision oracle caught temporary range lifetime bug and fixed it. Mac affected
release and new ASan oracle passed; Linux affected debug/release/ASan passed
context/linux/run-s7bg00gp. No old pilot/backstop/capacity campaign rerun.

Actual OpenAI definition -> boundary -> later named g3_source_map invocation ->
retained source reads + useful35-match maintenance map delivered in
context/giga-campaign/g3/actual. Two old mixed-range failures repaired with bounded
Lua/native read, arconaut-k48 not fixed by implication.48509 actual tokens total,
dollar costs unavailable. Details papers/2026-10-07-lua-tools-delivery.md and usage
docs/LUA_TOOLS.md. Candidate publication distinct from pending native RRC and
master FF acceptance. Concurrent editor source0f1019c is now parent; uncommitted
palette/UI paths preserved/excluded, coherent source snapshot used for replacement.
No later unit started; controller working intent stays continue until activation.

G3 candidate fdd8511 pushed on giga/g3-live-lua-tools. Coherent clean source snapshot
built build/g3-release/arco (SHA25663f26f8a9b219b71eb77898a32dc1c7919a990edcc13848d87adb2a02dc2bcdd),
including accepted editor parent0f1019c, excluding dirty concurrent palette. Install
at build/release/arco and same-unit RRC next; whole deadline06:59:09UTC preserved.
Master remains de22bb2 until activation observation/checked FF; no accepted claim.

G3 accepted after actual same-session RRC observation05:52:18UTC: PID60700 started
05:51:05, build/release/arco SHA25663f26f8a9b219b71eb77898a32dc1c7919a990edcc13848d87adb2a02dc2bcdd.
Native tool_registry active; no tool inheritance from separate g3/actual session.
Source-map publication/reopen anchors used for operating notes (known mixed-range
read again handled with bounded Lua/native read; not fixed). Checked ancestors and
non-force master FF de22bb2..b7436e2 pushed. Concurrent qualified palette b7436e2
arrived at shared branch boundary; no dirty UI overwritten, G3 binary does NOT
include palette activation, which stays separate owner. Bead7iy.3 closed; bd backup
complete. G4 queued next fresh unit, not started. No third hardening or settled
checks rerun. Original unit completed well before06:59:09UTC.

## External editor and command palette ready for restart

Operator requests shipping both, then manually restarting interactive UI. Separate35min units: editor05:35:15 to06:10:15UTC, palette05:41:16 to06:16:16UTC; each<=10min hardening layers1+2 only. Editor0f1019c: idle CtrlG/current draft and /edit/blank, canonical screen/termios handoff to trusted VISUAL/EDITOR/vi, private bounded regular file, failure text/cursor retention, no implicit send or editor typeahead. Direct red, helper failure/security-boundary cases, actualPTY and one cleanup-ownership recheck passed. Paletteb7436e2/70575f2: ranked local search, CtrlSpace/T, keyboard selection, Enter loads only, Escape restoresdraft, previousdraft /drafts/capacity refusal, busy modal control and bounded resize viewport. Direct unit/PTY and one recheck + new native UI ASanUBSan cases passed. Test fixture corrections and one unintended model prompt are honestly recorded in palette paper; no product failure or replay inferred. Final feedback wording distinguishes emptydraft. No third assurance loop.

Coherent committed source70575f2 archived to bounded context/tui-palette/release-source, release built then installed atomically to build/release/arco05:55:44UTC (1049201bytes; source/SHA in release-ready.json). Excludes uncommitted G4 work. UI705 published master via checked nonforce fastforward from acceptedG3. Core now independently working G4; colleague access block unchanged. User interactive restart remains explicit; management development reload needed to observe compiled activation, without restarting other sessions. docs/CHAT_UX.md captures usage/limits. Beads/backups updated; checks settled.

Observed shared build collision at05:58UTC: G4 replaced build/release/arco with1068977byte/e96321bc candidate before qualification. Preserved it at context/giga-campaign/g4-built-before-ui-handoff; source remains owned by core. Checked70575f2 UI executable pinned to build/release/arco-ui (23ad00fa) and restored to shared path for development reload. Operator launcher must use ARCO_EXECUTABLE pinned path to avoid later builds selecting unrelated candidates. No unknown effects replay, no G4 activation/safety claim.

## G4 named retained modules/configuration candidate (2026-10-07)

7iy.4 start05:54:28.679526/deadline07:24:28.679526UTC unchanged. Complete named
module snapshot, audited source resolution, per-workflow cache/private assignments,
compile-only candidate validation, model/effort defaults and effective/pending
program/tool/policy inspection implemented. Durable boundary shares existing
context publication; failed/pause candidates preserve working snapshot. No atomic
interrupt/apply or staged workflow selector claim; first usable C2/C4 slice.
Grounding/design consequences and direct oracle outcomes in modules-config-delivery.
Hardening05:58..06:07:53 layers1+2 done, no third. Mac release/ASan passed; initial
Linux timeout retained debug pass and interrupted release, remote no longer living;
distinct targeted Linux release/ASan passed run-fpf3zpp3. No old campaign rerun.
Release06:04:18 includes accepted UI baseline370a90f. Candidate source publication,
RRC and actual useful maintenance-module use next before acceptance/promotion.

G4 actual native RRC observed06:10:41UTC: PID69080 start06:09:51UTC, recorded
06:04:18 release SHA matched; ordinary resumed Lua/tool conversation working.
Staged retained maintenance module through new API, pending revision
8358dd2ba60508bcba15000000000000; import unavailable in defining workflow.
Normal successful boundary then useful source/docs inventory next; not accepted
or master-promoted yet. Managed summary staged, originals/session path retained.
Independent startup-replay dirty source/script/test/paper left untouched/excluded.
Same deadline07:24:28.679526, hardening remains ended06:07:53/no third.

G4 scoped accepted after actual ordinary published maintenance import, revision
8358dd2ba60508bcba15000000000000: useful docs/G4_PROGRAM_MAP.md written via native
Lua/tool path,57 matches/4 actual source/docs/test paths. First inventory used
nonexistent guessed paths/external_unknown; retained failure, no completion/replay
claim. Acceptance uses settled Mac/Linux oracles + observed native activation/use,
not another hardening layer. C2 delivered; C4 request defaults/effective-pending view
slice delivered; staged governing workflow and atomic interrupt/apply deferred.
Remote/master70575f2 fetched/ancestor candidate; final FF follows this checkpoint.
Independent dirty startup-replay source/script/test/paper excluded and untouched.

G4 publication06:16:03UTC: fresh remote ancestor check then non-force master
70575f2 -> d52c40f succeeded; local master updated with expected-old CAS, no active
checkout switch. Independent startup-replay dirty work still untouched. G4 closed;
unit-state accepted at ordinary boundary, no later unit work in this invocation.

## G6 bounded synchronous orchestration candidate (2026-10-07)

7iy.6 original06:16:52.385066..07:46:52.385066UTC unchanged. Read doctrine,
campaign/current participant brief, existing workflow study and blocked G5 contract.
Implemented ordinary Lua sequential/selected branch/join/explicit safe retry with
owner/identity, immutable snapshots, finite counts and local pause. No async worker,
remote cancellation, native quiescence or replay claim. Red missing-module then
direct counted Mac/Linux Lua5.4.8 cases passed. Hardening06:20:42..06:21:52 layers1+2
complete; sparse join/contradictory unknown fixed, one formatting finding fixed,
no third assurance. Existing independent startup-replay dirty files left untouched.
Actual owned composition read current selected source, used existing G5 independent
candidate OpenAI context-only CLI once, joined completed outcomes and wrote useful
docs/G6_ORCHESTRATION_MAP.md; reported5085 tokens, billing unavailable. G5 external
heterogeneous account blockers unchanged/not retried. Named module staged revision
c7d34276b2ed4987ad0b000000000000; ordinary boundary then actual retained import/use
next, not accepted yet. Lua-only boundary activation; no native harness replacement.

G6 scoped accepted after successful-boundary retained activation: effective revision
c7d34276b2ed4987ad0b000000000000 observed06:24:40UTC, no pending candidate. Actual
arco.module import composed bounded reads of3 native/Lua ownership paths, selected
publication, completed join and useful G6_NATIVE_OWNERSHIP_MAP.md (41 anchors).
No provider replay or extra check layer. C3 synchronous composition accepted; async
scheduler/native participant messaging/persistent admissions remain unavailable,
not hidden delivered scope. G5 heterogeneous auth blocker unchanged. Lua-only
activation observed, no native rebuild/RRC. Remote/master b5c750a freshly fetched
and ancestor685ed31; selected G6 accepted-source publication/promotion next.
Other-owner startup-replay dirty paths still excluded. Unit deadline unchanged.

G6 source publication completed06:26UTC: candidate685ed31 -> accepted2fba085 pushed
candidate/g6-orchestration; freshly fetched remote/master b5c750a was ancestor and
non-force FF b5c750a..2fba085 succeeded. Local master expected-old CAS updated without
switching any active checkout. Bead7iy.6 closed, backup recorded. Original whole
unit completed ~10minutes after start; hardening remains finished, no native RRC
needed. Concurrent dirty startup-replay source remains its owner's candidate work,
excluded from source publication and not represented as accepted by this unit.
No later unit started. Remaining G6 unavailable async/native participant features
are explicit in queue/docs; G5 cross-provider access stays independently blocked.

## 2026-10-07 G7 station candidate

arconaut-7iy.7 starts06:27:04.372475UTC, deadline07:57:04.372475UTC.
Existing empty pilot-pool slot reused for clean G7 source/builds, preserving
unrelated startup-replay dirt in main checkout. Native local-file event admissions
and boundary pause/resume/steer/stop implemented with session ownership, retained
inputs, at-most-once source/id dispatch and unknown-reopen pause. Direct store and
actual-process oracles passed (idle audit unchanged; failed workflow actually
writes then fails, never redispatched). Baseline native rejects --station.
RRC process oracle preserves actor/scheduling without implicit continue.
Scoped source consequences, envelope and limits: G7_STATION_SUBPLAN/STATION.
Hardening06:33:37..06:58:37 allowance; layer1 passed Mac release and affected Linux
debug/release/ASan checks. One layer2 source recheck found full command-table pause
failure; native pause fact fixed it,4096-command exhaustion direct oracle passed.
Useful actual model-trigger delivery and same-session activation remain next.
No third review, provider panel, G5 access retry or old campaign recertification.
## Operator startup and waste audit (2026-10-07)

Operator reports launcher silent after ergonomics work; first confirmed real dev
loop alive G4, subsequently accepted G6 and advanced to G7. Reproduced315MB operator
session reopening; sampled full retained prefix cloning in replay and forward issue.
Written subplan/startup paper before code, direct allocation and byte-alias oracles,
semantic/crash/allocation tests, immutable shared payloads and batch-local replay
rollback. Replay-only identity/source index eliminates repeated prefix scans without
becoming a second authority. Mac release/ASan four affected checks passed. Tests'
private API fixture and inappropriate total allocation bound corrected honestly;
no source conclusion from those invalid oracles. No additional certification loop.

Operator asks for Carmack-style waste audit: source/actual session census identifies
exact46.56MB duplicated invocation/admission inputs, all179 decisions embed same
logical input,96MB context packets,14,610 reservations/13,767 captures for179 admissions.
Ten ranked findings and bounded course in papers/2026-10-07-waste-audit.md; persistent
byte discipline added to AGENTS. No new libraries/auth, history deletion, production
Python or invented universal speed/heap/cost numbers. Audit scripts ignored context;
published aggregate sizes/counts only. Next source-addressed inputs/capture cadence,
prepared suffix/context index, then measured provider/UI work. Linux scoped check
explicit follow-up; no blanket validation gate.

Published isolated accepted UI70575f2 plus retained fixes to arco-ui, excluding
concurrent candidate source. Interactive launcher selects published UI; unattended
once keeps development release, explicit executable override wins. Actual operator
session reopened successfully to prompt in12.0578s; startup still has measured work
remaining, not called instantaneous. Original audit unchanged except normal appended
session/identity facts. Native/profile source locators retained in context/startup-replay.

## Remaining operator startup latency (2026-10-07)

Operator explicitly reopens optimization scope:12s unacceptable. Same-session12.1236s
reproduced; sampled2041/2127 frames in bit-serial CRC. Studied quarantined LevelDB
CRC design and qualified compiler arm_acle intrinsics; implemented generated portable
slicing-by-8 plus compile-target-guaranteed ARM CRC acceleration, no library. Also
replaced payload handle linear membership scans with binary sequence search and full
handle comparison; record sequence gaps remain allowed. All checksum/recovery/unknown
fences retained, no audit copying/cache/history deletion. Initial table generation
ordering bug directly caught by RFC/fixed-wire oracles and corrected before activation.
Exact bit-serial/seed/offset/split oracle covers both hardware and forced portable
builds; forged physical handles rejected. Five affected release/ASan checks pass.
Measured315MB retained operator session1.3661s to prompt, previously4.4377s portable
and12.1236s original. Ordinary cache/load uncontrolled, not cold-start guarantee.
Published checked UI archive binary atomically to arco-ui; real TUI reopened preserved
conversation and /quit works. Live G7 dev loop observed independently, executable
untouched. Publish scoped source on candidate and master excluding G7 candidate code.

G7 actual source-trigger delivery: native PID87484, fresh g7-worker-run1, one
admission for duplicated source event, ordinary OpenAI tools wrote useful
G7_NATIVE_STATION_MAP.md in112.995s. Operator pause retained PID/actor/context head;
explicit stop exit0. Initial background PID87080 did not reach admission (112byte
header only); original path/unknown final boundary preserved. No replay claim.
Final affected Linux source2a34415 checks passed; ASan command-cap oracle390.15s.
Combined independently accepted startup0f01f2c into5e58d51, preserved journal;
Mac affected integration cases passed06:55:43, no blanket Linux recertification.
Read new waste audit; repeated full snapshot capture/status serialization deferred
visibly, not fixed under a third hardening layer. Clean release5e58d51 installed
SHA8572bb3ba2e9ff9eb18aa1b4d06b7868d6aedb0c8e84a182c3b20ccd203dd7c9.
Same-unit native RRC next; source5e58d51 candidate pushed, acceptance/master pending.

## G7 scoped acceptance / actual native activation (2026-10-07)

Same-session RRC continued native PID91133 start06:59:23UTC, observed06:59:31UTC;
installed release SHA8572bb3ba2e9ff9eb18aa1b4d06b7868d6aedb0c8e84a182c3b20ccd203dd7c9
matched built5e58d51. G7 local-file station/control scoped accepted after actual
source-trigger useful station map, duplicate single admission, same-actor operator
pause/stop and completed affected checks. Eight live provider requests aggregate
36600 input/3354 output/39954 total reported tokens; billing unavailable.
Hardening finished06:50:16; no third layer or settled-suite rerun. Original unit
deadline07:57:04.372475UTC unchanged. Source owns backlog, latest boundary controls
not a command queue; unknown attempts stay unknown/no replay, no remote settlement
or crash containment claim. Repeated snapshot/status cadence costs are separate
bounded follow-up, not silent scope expansion. Close bead and publish via checked
non-force master fast-forward; no later unit implementation in this session.

G7 publication boundary07:00:41UTC: fresh origin/master is a82ec5a, not an
ancestor of shared local HEAD87419ba (concurrent startup owner committed on
this branch after08f22ea). Non-force FF prerequisite failed. STOP: no merge,
force push or second activation. Running G7 native remains built5e58d51, not
new local87419ba. Candidate preserves both owners' work; G7 reopened blocked
pending explicit branch reconciliation/publication, not called campaign accepted.

## Root fleet check-in / G7 integration (2026-10-07)

Fleet observed G8 active with native92256/supervisor92246; G5 parked on provider
auth/credit failures. G7 qualified station source/native activation completed, but
publication blocked on independently published startup master. Reconciled immutable
f961248 candidate and a82ec5a master off the active checkout. Only merge conflict
was append-only JOURNAL; retained both owners entries. Identical startup source
changes deduplicated by Git; no G8 dirty/untracked work admitted. Existing G7 scoped
checks and useful station observation retained, no third certification. Checked
non-force merged-source publication, no running binary replacement.

## G8 optional packages/HUD candidate (2026-10-07)

arconaut-7iy.8 only,07:01:37.892952..08:31:37.892952UTC. Inert optional
Lua package contract plus public GitHub releases adapter/metadata; thematic
C++/Lua text HUD, explicit selected context and prepared station event routes.
Native number/library source inspection corrected tagged JSON/no-os assumptions
before activation. Direct Mac embedded Lua and Linux5.4.8 cases passed;
hardening07:08..07:10:56UTC layers1+2 complete, no third. Actual native receipt
794b42c728ab44a0f612000000000000 fetched LLVM23.1.2/23.1.3; HUD displayed/written,
context0/action0 honestly distinct. Source consequences/restoration and interface
in G8_PACKAGES_SUBPLAN/PACKAGES; limits/evidence in packages-delivery paper.
Fresh remote master38fa47c was strict descendant, protected dirty candidate and
checked FF, restored on giga/g8-packages-hud. No conflict, force or known-defective
merge. Pending module revision794b42c728ab44a0aa16000000000000 compiles; successful
normal boundary publication still pending. Same-unit next turn imports retained
modules, explicitly includes chosen item and routes useful station work. No new
native RRC, dependency/account adoption, upgrade, G5 retry or later-unit coding.
G8 candidate a0d96f1 committed and pushed to origin/giga/g8-packages-hud.
Queue remains G8 active/continue, not accepted/master-promoted. Retained modules
publish only at this successful ordinary boundary; next turn checks actual use.

## G8 actual activation / useful source-trigger delivery (2026-10-07)

Same-unit07:14UTC observed effective retained module revision
794b42c728ab44a0aa16000000000000, both imports passed. New native release snapshot

794b42c728ab44a0231d000000000000. Adapter parent/write-result mistake surfaced
as known startup invalid_range before admission; corrected caller, documented.
First actual station then failed8 bounded model calls mixing ranges, paused with
unknown admission; outer wait timed out while idle/paused. Original
context/g8/station-worker retained, output_ref794b42c728ab44a0a51f000000000000;
no replay, final timeout boundary/billing unknown. Backlog arconaut-qqy scoped.
Independent explicitly selected source-packet action in context/g8/decision-worker
uses separate source/action/artifact, no predecessor authority. Native bounded
reads -> request with selected feed facts and source packet/tools0 -> useful
G8_TOOLCHAIN_DECISION.md -> explicit stop, exit0 in20.72s. One admission from

Earlier unknown station path/final boundary retained, not retroactively settled.

## Claude access restored (2026-10-07)

Operator reauthenticated Claude. Actual existing native colleague adapter completed
Sonnet4.6 readiness, reported210input/5output tokens, exit0/remote completed. Prior
selected-source review120s and narrowed60s request timed out unknown/io, no output;
not completed reviews/auth failures or settled remote requests. Direct CLI readiness
also worked. Recorded exact distinctions in papers/2026-10-07-claude-auth-restored.md.
Auth blocker removed; G5 useful work/source integration still pending. No core/G8
source changes, repeat certification or credential disclosure.

## Grok Build installed (2026-10-07)

Operator declines Kimi resubscription for now, requests Grok Build installation to
expand available colleagues alongside MiMo. Consulted official xAI docs/repository,
downloaded/inspected official installer then installed stable native macOS arm64
1.0.46 (2765805b9442). Version/full help/login help succeed; ~/.local/bin/grok on PATH,
installer managed shell completion/PATH and external ~/.grok installation. No stored
auth or inherited API/deployment credential; inference awaits operator grok login.
Recorded tooling/GROK.md, hash and actual limits; no Arco provider integration claim,
production dependency, Kimi purchase, running campaign interruption or new auth probe.

## 2026-10-07 07:25–07:32 UTC — G9 security decision blocked

Root working context authorizes arconaut-7iy.9 only; bead identifies two independent
P2P E2EE peers, not another backstop unit. Clean starting checkout5b6eece; candidate
branch `giga/g9-security-decision`, no worktree proliferation. Original whole-unit
07:25:14.674231..08:55:14.674231UTC unchanged. Bounded requirements/source reads
confirm crypto/key lifecycle unselected; existing provider curl is not native peer
TLS, station source/id admission does not establish remote authentication.

Delivered papers/2026-10-07-peer-security-decision.md: proposed opt-in OpenSSL
TLS1.3 mutual authenticated/pinned direct peers; explicit benefit/cost vs libsodium
primitive composition; out-of-band enrollment, provider/plaintext-audit and traffic
metadata limits; exact authentication, duplicate/conflict, unknown send, paused
intent, bounded resources and two-context useful-work oracles. Three bounded curl
acquisitions succeeded, hashes/restoration recorded, no new dependency adopted or
source executed. No model/reviewer/provider calls, builds or runtime qualification;
service billing unavailable. Missing operator decision blocks implementation, not
permission for plaintext transport or owned cryptography.

Documentation hardening07:29..07:32UTC (deadline07:34, max5min inside unit): layer1
checked API verification defaults, absent native crypto dependency, authenticated
provenance versus station payload and receipt versus completion; fixed proposal to
keep exact trust-store policy pending and exclude resumption/0-RTT. Layer2 one
source/contract and staged-whitespace recheck; no third layer or old-suite reruns.
Bead marked blocked with exact decision/next action; campaign queue and quarantine
manifest updated. Candidate source/evidence preserved; no accepted-unit/master
activation claim, native change or RRC. Request OpenSSL/dependency + enrollment +
threat-model decision before further G9 implementation under the original deadline.

## Grok auth and general phux multiplexing study (2026-10-07)

Operator signed into Grok. Actual grok-4.7-build readiness completed2.768s; bounded
CRC review60s returned no output/unknown after local termination, not a review.
Recorded both without credential contents. Operator then selected phall's phux for
Arco multiplexing generally. Acquired intact20MB source archive/extracted reference,
read resource/lifecycle/terminal-control/remote source, bounded AgentSession retention
and reported benchmark boundaries. Recommendation external optional service: Arco
TUI lives in phux pane, compact lifecycle projection, shared terminal orchestration,
Arcoboard consumption; shared server unaffected by individual refit. Arco audit/task
semantics remain distinct. No install/dependency adoption or empirical phux claim.
Study papers/2026-10-07-phux-multiplexing.md and QUARANTINE restoration retained.

## Official external phux support (2026-10-07)

Operator selects officially supported external tool, no additional core. Installed
official stable0.52.0 with upstream checksum verification. Thin scripts/arco-phux
literal-argument/cwd launcher and docs/PHUX.md/README support. First naked-new cold
launch seeded default shell; source study identified preseed path, replaced launcher
with atomic new--json then attach. Actual fresh Arco TUI/model turn, geometry-safe
snapshots, same-process detach/reattach, RRC native8467->9391 keeping wrapper8463,
same session-info and retained output. Bare /restart check corrected to NOTE syntax.
Separate shell run10s timed out, retained unresolved rather than broad hardening.
Private profile/socket/server stopped, operator default and dev loop untouched.
No C++/Lua core dependency or native lifecycle projection delivered. Source grounding
and actual support limits in papers/docs, no phux runtime qualification inference.

## Supported partner tool link (2026-10-07)

Operator requested a direct phux repository link in README as a supported partner
tool. Added the link and attribution beside the existing launch instructions.
Documentation-only change; checked the diff and whitespace.

## Repository About description (2026-10-07)

Operator requested repository presentation and a permissive license retaining
authorship. Set GitHub About to describe the C++/Lua agent, expert operators,
model-editable workflows, managed context and self-development. Proposed MIT
with Patrick Beam copyright; license selection awaits clarification of whether
commercial forks are intended to be permitted. No license added yet.

## MIT license shipped (2026-10-07)

Operator approved MIT with Copyright (c) 2026 Patrick Beam. Added standard MIT
LICENSE, README license section and explicit exclusion of third-party Qud artwork
and adaptations from the project grant. GitHub About already configured. Checked
license text against the OSI MIT reference, notice, artwork boundary and whitespace.
Documentation-only; no runtime tests required. Published accepted files to master
without switching or merging the active campaign checkout.

## Mascot and artwork withdrawn (2026-10-07)

Operator requests removal from Arco after Arcoboard drafts were withdrawn. Plan:
delete sprite header/image, rendering and animation-only wakeups; return the
conversation to full width; remove attribution file/README credit/license carveout
and obsolete mascot subplan/guide paragraph. Keep historical journal/literature
and Git records. Update affected PTY checks to require no overlay in wide/narrow
views, preserving scroll/resize/cursor/cancellation oracles. Build release and run
only terminal and terminal_pty checks; publish accepted change and interactive
executable. No graphics replacement, core dependency or campaign restart.

## Halt and consolidation (2026-10-07)

Operator halts autonomous development, defers multiplayer implementation, and
requests unified main plus a local build. Armada admission and both registered
jobs paused; process observation finds no matching worker/supervisor. Retain
reservations/source/unknown outcomes, do not resume or replay. G9 security study
is discussion, not an approved implementation. Frumentarii now independently
study P2P transport, multiplayer state and E2EE primary literature/refimpls.
Consolidate accepted source and historical work notes on master, reconcile current
status and inventory unaccepted branches; do not merge candidate code blindly.

## Unified master stock

Merged current accepted source and accumulated study/operating notes onto master,
resolving duplicate selective-publication conflicts with complete current versions.
No unaccepted colleague/TUI-shell/useful-work-tools source merged. Preserved exact
branch tips/worktrees in docs/BRANCH_INVENTORY.md and material delivery limits in
docs/CURRENT_STATE.md. Corrected G7 publication and campaign paused status; earlier
journal claims remain historical. Rebuild local main for operator use; no multiplayer
implementation or autonomous resume authorized by this consolidation.

## Networking corpus and actual local main

Three frumentarii completed P2P, multiplayer-state/game-networking and E2EE
literature/reference studies, preserving archives/manifests and acquisition gaps.
Root read delivery findings and key ownership/identity/lifecycle sections, then
used them in papers/networking-2026-10-07/SYNTHESIS.md: distinguish custody from
action, allow specified same-ID reconciliation, no inference/effect rollback,
per-hop relay TLS not E2EE, live revocation and secret audit exclusions, group
commit conflict and aggregate byte bounds. No multiplayer stack selected.

Main source built locally; release terminal and terminal_pty2/2 passed (11.69s).
Atomic local publication to build/release/arco-ui (launcher interactive generation).
Actual fresh TUI context/main-preview/session using gpt-6.1-sol medium returned
MAIN_READY, provider2843ms,1886 reported tokens. Turn completed, then /quit exited0
and restored terminal. No user session or autonomous campaign was resumed.
A redundant concurrent build was started after checkout consolidation. Root stopped
only that build's identified descendants and completed serial linking successfully.
The final serially linked executable differed from the earlier tested generation
and was atomically installed as arco-ui. Recheck only terminal and terminal_pty
on this final artifact to resolve the concurrent-build uncertainty; no broad suite.

Compared unique old branch commits: useful-work request-write fence already in main
with direct regression; old TUI shell superseded by editor/palette. Colleague source
is genuine separate candidate, explicitly not silently accepted by consolidation.

Final serial main release terminal/terminal_pty recheck passed2/2 in8.91s; final
local launcher generation installed, no mascot references in source/current guide
or README. Master checkout clean after journal publication. Campaign stays paused;
research corpus delivered, multiplayer design/implementation not launched.

## Exclusive read_file selector

Operator approves one range object with mode lines/bytes and start/end; omit
range for whole file. Advertise no competing byte/line fields and reject unknown
range keys or combined old/new selectors. Keep valid historical Lua ranges as
unadvertised compatibility; migrate current helpers. Preserve exact originals,
indexing, LF/EOF/binary behavior and process-output contract. Enrich invalid-range
model results without converting audited failure to success. Direct oracles:
canonical slice bytes/schema, malformed selectors, old valid calls, audited error
and corrected retry, Lua helper arguments. Bound remediation/recheck to25min,
two layers only; no autonomous campaign or multiplayer implementation.

Exclusive-selector result: direct tools oracle failed on old implementation, then
release tools/useful_work checks passed. New coding fixture initially failed because
its audit directory lacked owner-only permissions; corrected fixture, coding passed
12.15s. Audited failure disposition preserved and returned example successfully read
source. Focused source/format recheck found no new defect. Actual gpt-6.1-sol medium
turn made canonical lines1..3 and bytes0..10 reads of README.md, both completed,
8.608s total; 6095 reported tokens across3 requests. Exact admitted arguments
checked in retained audit; no legacy/mixed selector or retry. Install local UI, close
both reports of the same range-mixing fault, keep campaign paused. No third layer.

## Vivid TUI and slash-command study — 2026-10-07

Operator requests study of the local harness corpus and a concrete plan for an
attractive terminal, automatic slash discovery, arrow navigation and basic command
completion. Clarifies visual quality, animations, color and useful information
density are immediate work; advanced controls follow. No Superdesign/design SaaS.
Read focused command/presentation source from Codex, Pi, OpenCode, Crush, Kimi,
Vibe, Gemini; OMP command-discovery documentation. Acquire official Xiaomi
MiMo-Code and Meta muse-code-sdk immutable ZIPs, retain originals in shared archive
shelf, extract clean ignored references and record pins/SHA/restoration. MiMo vivid
mode/spinner and Unicode completion tests inform design. Muse SDK/protocol is
public but host/TUI absent; distinguish source evidence from official user manual.

Write papers/2026-10-07-terminal-ux-study.md and docs/TUI_PLAN.md: visual shell and
motion first, inline slash menu/basic commands, typed conversation/tool rendering,
then measured tuning. Explicit no full-history reflow on animation ticks, actual
terminal geometry, preserved audit originals, boundary activation and Ctrl-C.
Track substantive implementation as arconaut-os3; existing tiny-window issue stays
relevant. Discussion plan only: no product code or dependency adoption, no campaign
restart/multiplayer launch. Documentation checked for whitespace and local links;
production tests are not applicable to this source acquisition/design unit.

## Inline slash commands and bordered terminal — 2026-10-07

Operator supplies Ghostty screenshot of slash hint wall and requests concrete
implementation. Written sub-plan docs/TUI_SLASH_SUBPLAN.md. Add automatic inline
menu on manually typed leading slash, filter, arrow selection, highlighted result,
Tab fill and Enter run-or-fill. Escape preserves draft, Ctrl-C stops, recalled and
pasted text does not open menu. Modal palette remains separate and preserves its
draft-recovery/Enter-load contract. Composer receives rounded cyan borders and
adaptive one-to-six-row viewport; shorten session path in header and add status
rule. Actual physical dimensions replace artificial upward clamp, with a minimal
small-terminal composer fallback. Advanced pickers, motion and typed Markdown/tool
rendering remain in arconaut-os3; this is not the entire TUI redesign.

New composer oracle fails before implementation. Compiler rejects implicit size
conversions; corrected types. An early test invocation raced linking and observed
old binaries; discard those results. Completed-build checks find old Tab/common-
prefix and fixed-row cursor expectations; update them to the deliberately changed
visible selection and bordered adaptive geometry, keeping exact dispatch/cursor,
scroll-anchor and recovery oracles. Review dismisses inline state on kill/cursor
motions. Final release terminal and terminal_pty pass2/2 in9.41s, including actual
slash opening, selected row, arrow/Tab, help dispatch, paste, active cancellation,
editor handoff, reopen, native restart isolation and streaming scroll. No provider
request or broad certification. Atomically install final build/release/arco as
arco-ui for scripts/arco; existing operator process is untouched and needs relaunch.

## Rich chat and lean renderer proposal — 2026-10-07

Operator requests study/proposal before implementation after new Ghostty screenshot;
then emphasizes buttery rendering, C-programmer economy, critical-systems lessons,
redundancies and zero fat/filler. Trace merged engine display/process/status paths:
request-size/usage JSON reaches flat transcript, preventing semantic invalidation.
Read agent message/code/tool/caching source (Codex, Pi, OMP, Crush), OMP cold-versus-
streaming tests and late-preview rejection. Acquire/read FTXUI native canvas/easing
and actual Draw/ToString; latter serializes whole screen, so do not adopt it as a
frequent-update shortcut. Acquire/read Notcurses C cell-damage/wide glyph handling,
inline/pool graphemes and buffer writing; its blocking finalize is a tradeoff, not
our latency solution. libvterm C contiguous buffers/explicit damage merging provide
another independent source model. Keep source ZIPs intact, clean extraction/pins.

Write docs/CHAT_PRESENTATION_PROPOSAL.md with concrete conversation language,
color/code/diff/tool/metrics/motion, docs/design/chat-concept.svg illustrative visual,
and papers/2026-10-07-rendering-internals-study.md with fast path and failure handling.
Modern terminal protocol study uses primary Ghostty/Kitty docs: synchronized output
and changed-cell writes; graphics optional, OSC66 not assumed in Ghostty GUI.
Explicit reusable bounded buffers/caches, no per-cell strings, source mappings,
Unicode footprints, partial-write/backpressure state, stale-frame handling,
full-repaint/raw/capability fallbacks and direct comparative performance oracles.
No language-superiority claim, no production dependency adoption, no product code
or test execution/qualification claim. Campaign remains paused. Update arconaut-os3
with proposal links; local link/XML/whitespace checks only for this document unit.

## Native chat renderer and one tribunal — 2026-10-07

Implement approved first chat presentation unit from the studied Notcurses,
libvterm, FTXUI and harness references: typed roles/notice/tool/usage callbacks,
prose hierarchy, styled fenced code, restrained rails, activity motion and footer.
Viewport cells hold inline scalar plus pooled tails (12 bytes); cached chat rows
avoid idle/animation history reflow. Damage painter emits changed cell runs inside
synchronized updates, committing only after its nonblocking packet is written.
Worker/self-pipe and SIGWINCH wake the terminal. Preserve audit and plain mode.

Operator requests exactly one adversarial tribunal. Three reports in papers:
chat-review-memory, chat-review-io, chat-review-render. Fix their concrete Unicode,
cluster overwrite/fallback, source/derived expansion, unfinished-line cost,
output handoff, Escape deadline, tiny-frame invalidation, outcome and restored
role issues. Add styled stream/cold comparisons and independent full/delta VT
oracle. Bounded projection chooses line clipping/eviction rather than unbounded
parser complexity; audit originals remain intact. On eviction explicitly return
to live tail; surviving-anchor preservation remains backlog. Dispositions and
actual measurement limits in papers/2026-10-07-chat-review-disposition.md.

Release focused 5/5 pass in32.93s; ASan chat_view passes. Local painter microfixture
1000 updates34,981us/67,932bytes, not end-to-end latency. Actual undrained PTY quit
177ms restores configured termios and fd flags; macOS kernel PENDIN explains an
initial overly strict whole-structure assertion. Actual provider-free native TUI
capture docs/design/chat-native-preview.svg. No second review, campaign restart,
new production dependency, or premature Blackbird rename.

Configured release rigor: all42tests pass115.40s. Repository-wide formatting then
fails on older retained-events/backstop/candidate/tool source/tests. Changed files
pass formatting. Targeted analysis identified new wrap-copy/enum-sentinel/border-
parameter diagnostics; fix these without suppression. Older editor-cleanup
analyzer/schema-parameter warnings remain backlog. Do not claim full rigor green.
Final new-renderer clang-tidy clean; final renderer/VT/terminal/PTY recheck4/4 in
11.34s. Record old lint debt arconaut-lh1. Publish qualified native binary atomically
as build/release/arco-ui for scripts/arco; operator's running process untouched.

## Blackbird rename, SR-71 and native profiling — 2026-10-07

Operator executes rename and asks to restore mascot as Kelly Johnson's magnum
opus, then wire profilers; additionally requests board identity/sprite. Move
checkout to projects/blackbird with old-path symlink; stop/restart only its own
Dolt server around relocation. Rename current namespace/includes/build/runtime/
launcher/Lua primary API. Preserve retained format, identity/data, issue IDs,
historical research and quarantined sources. Lua arco is the exact same table;
old launcher/build names remain. Existing legacy default is selected until a new
Blackbird default exists. New current guide USING_BLACKBIRD; old guide redirects.

Original36x8 SR-71 silhouette in two existing header rows, cached Braille frames,
active exhaust on existing clock, reserved text space and narrow hiding. Board
uses same original silhouette, name/defaultroot and blackbird-board alias; old
command remains. No copied image or Qud asset, no added core dashboard burden.

Optimized-symbol/frame-pointer profile preset; finite private capture wrapper for
sample, Instruments CPU/allocations/system and optional Linux perf. Provider-free
native layout/composition/paint fixture. Sample source-resolved stacks and serial
CPU trace/export pass. Concurrent Instruments fail: serialize with lock. Allocation
attach/launch fails; profile-only get-task-allow signing fixes actual attachment.
Never change machine-wide developer mode; release artifact signing unchanged.
Counters span whole fixture/init/teardown, not only sample window.

One tribunal reports compatibility missing-output, failed/interrupt profiler
reporting, offset-wide-cell footprint and board flame/status defects. Fix and
perform direct rechecks; no second review. Refuted ETXTBSY finding requires no
change. Full local release41/42 initially only old resume-command expectation;
final6/6 relevant recheck33.27s covers canonical expectation and alias. Board
installed command PTY title/sprite/quit passes after keeping output drained.
Actual preview in evotools papers/blackbird-board-preview.svg. Profiling known
machine/tool limitations are in docs/PROFILING and review-disposition paper.

Final Neuroses debug/release/ASan+UBSan focused native/VT/terminal/session/RRC
checks pass across all three profiles. Initial remote run caught the same old
resume-command expectation; corrected once with explicit canonical name. Local
final6/6 and actual profiler failure/interruption/reaping checks pass. Missing
compatibility executable is restored by its target. Install blackbird-ui and
legacy arco-ui atomically. Board update committed/pushed separately in evotools.
One review round only; existing general lint debt remains explicitly open.

## 2026-10-07 — Banking SR-71

Operator requested a banking three-quarter mascot rather than the side profile.
Redrew the original 36x8 bit silhouette in the harness and external board, showing
swept wings, separated nacelles, and two animated exhaust trails. Cached frames,
header footprint and idle behavior remain unchanged. Release rebuild and the
chat_view/chat_render_oracle checks pass (2/2); board Lua parsing and --once pass.

## 2026-10-07 — Startup aircraft and square status avatar

Operator supplied a better front-three-quarter SR-71 reference and requested
large startup art with ASCII BLACKBIRD lettering, shrinking into a square in the
upper-right corner. Its color should communicate operational state. The plan:
keep both drawings code-native; render a local welcome view, dismiss on first
operator input without touching retained chat/context, and reserve a right gutter
for a cached 24x24-bit / 12x6-cell square. Small terminals adapt or hide the avatar.
Colors use existing inks: idle muted, active cyan, tool amber, failed red; exhaust
uses the existing busy clock. The board shares geometry and observed fleet states.

One bounded principal-engineer review found short-height/composer overlap and
manual resume skipping startup; both were fixed. The avatar requires enough space
above the composer/palette. Restored chat stays behind welcome until operator input;
automatic continuation bypasses welcome. No rereview or new dependency.

PTY verification also exposed stale-screen synchronization in the existing reopen
fixture: clearing observed bytes retained the previous child's screen, allowing
an old composer/help marker to satisfy a fresh-launch wait. Each launched process
now gets a fresh screen oracle. New avatar assertions wait for state changes,
rather than previously visible help/border text. Actual-cell startup and avatar
SVG previews are retained under papers. Final check results follow below.

Final checks: local chat_view/chat_render_oracle pass2/2; actual native terminal
PTY checks pass, including large startup -> square avatar, idle/tool/failure
colors and short-height hiding. Board Lua parse, --once, and actual controlling
PTY title/avatar/clean quit pass. Neuroses debug, release and ASan+UBSan each pass
all three selected cases; capture context/linux/run-mrgo76i0/checks.log. One review
round only. Release blackbird-ui and arco-ui copies are atomically refreshed.

## 2026-10-07 — Use the supplied artwork

The operator rejected the redraw: they had already supplied a better sprite.
Both attachments are PNGs, including the ASCII-looking one. Stored the exact
first attachment in assets/sr71.png; matching SHA-256 confirms unchanged bytes.
The missing startup art was the prior height/width fallback dropping the drawing.

Replaced the invented startup airplane with direct terminal image placement in
known local Ghostty/Kitty terminals, grounded in their protocol documentation.
Terminal-owned decode/cache; the harness only encodes a filename. The same image
is large on startup (including80x24), then a corner square with state indicator.
Resizing/repositioning transmits small controls, never repeated PNG payloads.
Cursor, quiet replies, synchronized single-writer frames and owned-image cleanup
are explicit. The board uses the same file and a distinct image ID.

One bounded adversarial review found missing tiny-terminal erase and inherited
90-column cutoff blocking80-column corner placement. Both fixed. Added DEC cursor
save/restore and APC skipping to the existing VT oracle. Direct launcher PTYs at
80x24 and120x40 pass: correct PNG filename, single upload, cached relocation,
unchanged composer cursor, tiny-terminal erase and exit pixel release. Existing
text/terminal/render checks pass as well. No production dependency adopted.

Final recheck: local chat_view/render-oracle pass2/2; full native terminal PTY
suite passes, including both forced-graphics launcher sizes. Board80x24 controlling
PTY verifies asset filename, square placement, named image release and clean quit;
Lua parse passes. Filename payload bounded to the protocol's4096-byte base64
payload (3072 raw path bytes). Launcher exports the checkout's asset path, so
moving the checkout does not depend on the compiled resource path. Atomic UI
binary copies refreshed. Previous ASCII preview SVGs remain historical captures.

## 2026-10-07 — Modern wordmark and README badge

Replaced the five-row hash lettering with a six-row solid block BLACKBIRD wordmark
and double-line shadow edges. Its 67-cell width is checked at compile time;
startup fit uses cell dimensions, not UTF-8 byte length. Terminal image geometry
now follows the actual wordmark: wide screens put it beside the square aircraft,
80x24 stacks it above an 11-row square. The exact supplied startup PNG remains
unchanged and retains its single-upload/cached-placement behavior.

Placed the operator's Claude-supplied pixel-art badge at the top of README as
assets/blackbird-readme.png, unchanged from the attachment (SHA-256
6184d61caffc0d8ca44dee3f28335925b9fb90f9c7338cc02ae8a73ba569d0e3).
The untracked art bundle remains local; no scripts or dependencies adopted.

Direct test first rejected the old five-row lettering. After implementation,
release chat_view, render-oracle and terminal_pty pass 3/3, including launcher
80x24 and 120x40, composer cursor, cached corner relocation and pixel release.
Atomic blackbird-ui and arco-ui release aliases refreshed.

One narrow adversarial review found no actionable defects. Independent wcwidth
checks confirm every wordmark glyph is one cell and all rows occupy 67 cells;
layout bounds and exact README asset bytes were checked. Report retained in
papers/2026-10-07-wordmark-review.md. No further assurance round added.

## 2026-10-07 — Which remote branches still matter

Fetched/pruned origin and queried GitHub heads/open PRs, then compared every real
remote branch against ee8f1e3. There are 32 heads: master, 28 ancestor checkpoints,
and three tips with one unique commit each. Only giga-colleagues has substantive
unintegrated source. Inspected the old TUI-shell and useful-work fixes against
current declarations, dispatch, write fence and regression: both superseded.
The 12 economy refs all share one ancestor commit. No open PRs were reported.
Updated docs/BRANCH_INVENTORY.md with exact tips and recommendations. No branches,
worktrees or tags changed; no provider requests or unnecessary test reruns.

## 2026-10-07 — Retire remote branch clutter

Operator authorized the proposed cleanup. Refetched heads and confirmed every
retiring tip unchanged, with 28 contained in master and two superseded unique
commits. Published annotated archive tags for 76c4016 and 7cbc088 and deleted all
30 retired remote branches in one atomic push. A fresh heads/tag query confirms
only master and candidate/giga-colleagues remain, and both unique commits are
retained by published tags. No master history rewrite, blind candidate merge,
local worktree deletion or running process changes. Updated branch inventory
records the disposition and preserves the original tip snapshot.

## 2026-10-07 — Workflow study and renewed Blackbird autodev

Operator requests fresh Hermes and a workflow offering encompassing the ecosystem.
Acquired immutable fresh Hermes a3ed4a173070 and separate community hermes-workflows
9fc82fe73555, preserving previous source and intact shared ZIPs; catalogs/restoration
recorded. Read core delegation/grouped joins, cron admission/execution recovery,
Kanban task/workflow distinction and plugin fingerprint/result seams. Independent
reconnaissance maps 22 primary-reference systems and 12 primitives. Sources drive
proposed orders in docs/WORKFLOW_CAMPAIGN.md; no dependency or installer adopted.

Created workflow epic arconaut-3oz and W0 arconaut-3oz.1. Real gpt-6.1-sol/medium
Blackbird research run is in a one-slot candidate pool with independent session,
25-minute deadline and explicit report/order-sheet deliverables. It is source/design
work, not authorization to implement speculative APIs. Existing uncertain lanes and
operator TUI untouched. Native runner/supervisor retained; new job adopted into board.
The external supervisor's canonical launcher/error-prefix compatibility defect was
fixed with direct counted launches and published in evotools2cb4741.

Operator then adds persistent performance capture and comparative mechanism study.
Attached live5-second native sample and10-second Time Profiler capture; both retained
complete with metadata under context/workflows-campaign/performance. Continuous
resource collector attached under its own private resources directory; prior start
gap remains explicit. Refreshed optimized/symbolized profile binaries for future
allocation-capable launches; running release generation unchanged. Performance
orders separate OS observations from future native action spans and compare exact
work shapes against reference algorithms rather than treating best-in-class claims
as measured facts. No global permission changes or telemetry service.

## 2026-10-07 — Persist autodev observations and bound the stalled study

W0 request context grew to roughly316KB and repeated180-second transport timeouts
prevented any report. Stopped the local harness; its original25-minute allowance
expired. Audit/session and captures preserved; no candidate edits. Observed manager,
supervisor and harness gone, checkpointed unchanged source and released that slot;
remote provider outcome is not asserted. Board records the incomplete result.
Fresh Hermes and independent22-system/12-capability study are complete in primary.

Retained complete native stack, TimeProfiler and SystemTrace windows plus520
continuous observations. CPU, footprint/resident memory, disk I/O, process identity,
storage growth and collector costs are persisted; unsampled children, initial gap,
provider/network and allocation attribution remain explicit limits. New optimized
profile build is prepared for subsequent native captures.

The read-only Darwin collector received one code review; root/parent identity
races and terminal-metadata failure paths fixed and directly checked. Automatic
launch wrapper received one narrow review; replacement uses owned Popen handles,
preflights capture writes before workload launch, tolerates subsequent telemetry
failures and retains both exit outcomes. Direct CPU/exit7, signal143 and terminal
metadata checks passed. Integration exposed systemPython3.9 missing file_digest;
bounded128KiB streamed hashing fixed and directsystem-interpreter attachment passed.
No second review, production dependency, global permission change or repeated suite.

Operator now authorizes a distinct W1 implementation unit: shared Lua workflow
registry, configurable slash aliases/prefix, POWERWORDS such as ultracode and TUI
coloring, with continuous profiling from launch. Scope and directchecks are in
WORKFLOW_REGISTRATION.md; issue arconaut-3oz.2. W0 budget is not renewed under W1.

## 2026-10-07 — W1 launched with automatic collection

Published research/profiling unit8342bb1 on master. Archived incomplete W0 without
renewing its allowance and reused the clean existing slot for a distinct W1 branch,
candidate/workflow-core-2026-10-07, pushed before work. New fresh session at
context/workflows-core; gpt-6.1-sol/medium, absolute25-minute allowance. Uses optimized
profile executable with profile-only attach entitlement. Mission includes brief/source
reading, short subplan, real implementation, direct checks, one bounded independent
review and explicit candidate commit/push. Shared registry, configurable slash
commands and exact-token colored POWERWORDS are operator-authorized deliverables.

Native candidate runner launches scripts/autodev-profiled automatically. Verified
real supervisor/harness/curl descendants and persisted observations from launch;
first request16.5KB, subsequent observed57.8KB. Enabled native opt-in context budget
131072-byte trigger/65536-byte advisory target in setup. Five-second native stack
window completed; finite allocation capture attached to the real profile harness.
Board adopted workflows-core; old lanes unchanged. Direct launch fault checks show
preflight failure starts no workload and later telemetry failure still waits the
command and retains terminal exit7. No extra review layer or budget reset.

## 2026-10-07 — First actual W1 performance interpretation

Operator asks what measured data shows. Saved785-second/781-observation snapshot:
22.62 harnessCPU-seconds,740sec loggedprovider calls,83.47MiB current/153.16MiB
sampled peak physicalfootprint,487646-byte latestrequest,75.09MB logicalaudit,
284.30MiB OSwrites. Collector2.28CPU-seconds (0.29% ofonecore),12.28MiB footprint.
Three stackwindows predominantlypoll; later windows also show sync, retainedevent
lookup, vector/snapshot bookkeeping and allocation/free. These define concrete
nextmeasurement targets; no leak or redundantpayload verdict from gauges alone.

Read nativecontextbudgetrequest construction: advisorytrigger and managedproposals
activate at successfulworkflowcompletion; longcurrentLua turn has no midrunboundary.
Thus configured131KBtrigger did not bound487KBrequest. Captured firstlook in papers;
allocationtrace recorded but peractiontotals not yet analysed. NativeInstruments
metadata includes environment, so rawtraces/privateexport stay ignored/local.

## 2026-10-07 — Local responsiveness governs the performance campaign

Operator requires ruthless speed on everything outside providercalls. Updated
PERFORMANCE_CAMPAIGN: active local action latency and p50/p95/p99/max, historysize
scaling, memory/copy costs and exact write/synccadence are first-class. LowaverageCPU
or providerdominated elapsedtime cannot establish localresponsiveness. Sourceand
stack evidence identify committedSnapshot vectorcopy, live linearfact lookup,
repeated requestmaterialization and durabilitysync as specific targets. Preserve
required durableacknowledgment/uncertaineffects; native instrumentation and matched
workload comparison precede selecting the largest local optimization. QueuedP1 as
arconaut-fsp; no speculative latency number or newdependency adopted.

W1 completed at13:09:05 and pushedc8498f0 within originalallowance. Four affected
checks passed. IndependentClaude review timedout90s withoutoutput; no rerun or
W1 allowance renewal. Candidate inactive/unmerged with outstandingreview already
authorized, not waiting for newpermission. Captureretains1390 observations; launcher
and collector both exited0. Reconciledlocal slot after cleancheckout, absentmanager
PIDs and libprocbirthcheck showed all213 sampled process identities no longerlive.
Unobserved escapedchildren/remote outcomes are not certified by those observations.
Board records reviewgap; primary/operatorTUI unchanged.

## 2026-10-07 — Restart useful autodev and flatten the real backlog

Operator asks actualautodevstate: W1finished, performancewasqueuednotrunning. Started
P1 on candidate/local-performance-2026-10-07, reusedcleanexisting slot after retaining

or taskhierarchy used merely to validate backlog bookkeeping.

## 2026-10-07 — Launch the local-performance armada

Operator asks a small BB fleet, then prioritizes dramatic issuer reservation
reduction and startup below100ms with large context. Launched two Blackbird
instances from14513f7 in a two-slot reusable pool: durable issuer ranges
(arconaut-02g, deadline1791382309) and intelligent startup restoration
(arconaut-n11, deadline1791382317). Existing P1 remains under original deadline
1791381225. All use gpt-6.1-sol/medium, optimized profile executable, persistent
resource/stack sampling, successful12-round turn boundaries and25-minute units.
New candidate branches pushed. Actual provider requests/resource JSONL observed
in both new lanes. No target claimed achieved at launch.

Ownership: P1 timing, issuer allocation/highwater, startup restoration/indexes.
Shared translation units integrate serially under Root. Audit authority, original
repair and unknown fences remain; startup measures audited-request readiness as
well as prompt. Reference study and direct oracles specified in missions.
docs/PERFORMANCE_ARMADA.md records scope/targets/follow-ups. Board adopts new runs
with global admission paused; limit5 accounts for3active plus2legacy holds. No old
campaign resumed or operator build/session changed.

One substantive independent W1 review completed within5minutes after earlier
Claude attempt yielded no report. Findings: palette selection out-of-range after
registry shrink; caught invocation-count exhaustion bypasses failure latch.
Report retained in papers; bead/flat backlog updated with direct repair oracles.
Candidate inactive; no second tribunal or review-of-review requested.

## 2026-10-07 — Design native Beads and preserve P1 handoff

Operator asks sketch/design then BB autodev on native Beads integration. Bounded
source research acquired exact installed0.58.0 upstream ae14933, intact archive
and cleaned reference. Study finds public GoAPI exists but no adopted nativeABI;
CLI supports atomic standalone claim, actual ready differs from list--ready,
and SQL writes may commit before a failing separate Dolt version commit. Explicit
create IDs can overwrite existing rows; no invented exactly-once retry. Child
BEADS_DIR binds primary config/database independently of candidate checkout.
docs/BEADS_DESIGN.md specifies shared native tools/Lua/slash facade, lazy binding,
no startup DB work, typed command-specific JSON and truthful unknown effects.
Existing bd external backend first; optional operator backend preference asked,
no reply before proceeding with stated default. No new dependency/service.

P1 ran four successful segments and exited0 at13:49:16, before original deadline,
without final actor handoff/commit. Actual independent Codex review DID return
five concrete findings; source applied fixes and direct rechecks. Root preserves
stopped source, actual review and aggregate measurements in pushed94bc2d4,
candidate/local-performance-2026-10-07. Four affected checks passed; four growing
history runs show disablednooutput and privatevalid2300-record JSONL/zero drops.
All221 sampled identities no longer match libproc; no inference about escaped
children/remote outcomes. Native pool settled/checkpointed/released, board records
inactive candidate, bead remains open for integration. No allowance extension,
extra review, primary build replacement or performance-target claim. Reuse slot
for independent Beads work after design, avoiding another permanent worktree.

One2-minute design check found two concrete seams, incorporated before launch:
native operation() must record unknown Beads writes as unknown retained terminal
facts, not merely JSON text; upstream readonly still runs version-maintenance,
so BB promises no initiated migration, not absolute foreign-backend nonmutation.
B1 targets the installed0.58 CLI, probes version before database commands and
uses deterministic fake backends for strict mutation/isolation oracles. Read-only
delivery is a coherent fallback if truthful native mutation settlement cannot fit.

B1 autodev launched on candidate/native-beads-2026-10-07 from0e51e11 after design
corrections, manager67681, absolute deadline1791383181. Reused freed P1 slot0,
fixed25-minute allowance, <=8successful12-round segments under same deadline,
gpt-6.1-sol/medium and automatic private profiling. New branch pushed. Actual
supervisor running/provider request and28resource observations verified. Full
typed operation surface preferred; safe whole read-path fallback is explicit.
No new dependencies, live mutation tests or startup backend probes authorized.
Board adopts B1 alongside active issuer/startup lanes; old campaigns paused.
Beads backup and journal/design/research checkpoints pushed on master.

## 2026-10-07 — Fleet status and stopped candidate reconciliation

Operator asks live status at14:36UTC. ZERO autodev runners active; manager and
supervisor PIDs absent, all16 observed native Blackbird identities absent.
B1 finished/pushed47bb9be at14:18 with one Codex review/fixes/directchecks; primary
integration pending. P1 retained94bc2d4 likewise inactive pending integration.

Reservation and startup exhausted four successful segments before completion,
at13:58:55 and14:06:50, leaving dirty partial code without handoffs. This is
Root's prepared-runner limit, not completion or a reason to renew expired units.
Reservation has no delivered count/performance oracle or review. Startup has two
passing context/workflow_repair checks and one static review with no substantive
findings; ALL10 large-fixture measurements exit1/error20, so no startup readiness
or speedup claim, especially not100ms. Preserved partial branches in pushed
02ff9ac and8e35f55 with candid reports/actual review. All106/209/147 sampled
identities respectively absent; unobserved descendants/remote outcomes not
inferred. Clean native slots checkpointed/released; board/beads updated. No
restart, new review or build activation. Added arconaut-kut for fixing future
continuation until explicit completion or SAME deadline, with honest partial
handoff. Successful turn boundaries must not be confused with finished units.

## 2026-10-07 — P1 local timing candidate checkpoint

Opt-in fixed-buffer local wall/thread-CPU spans, representative append/request
preparation and growing-history fixture implemented by BB. Four affected checks
passed; one independent Codex review reported five findings, fixes/direct
rechecks performed. Four successful segments ended before deadline without
final marker/commit. Root preserves useful source, actual review and aggregate
results in papers/2026-10-07-p1-measurements.md; no target/activation claim.
Candidate remains separate from master; raw records retained privately.

## 2026-10-07 — Integrate Beads and compile debug machinery out normally

Operator authorizes native Beads merge and instrumentation interfaces, clarifying
profilingON is not steady state and requests debugbuild bool defaultfalse. Merged
47bb9be and94bc2d4 onto master; resolved independent CMake target additions and
retained both journal histories. BLACKBIRD_DEBUG defaultsOFF, normal release
preset explicitlyOFF; debug/sanitizer/fuzz/profile presets explicitlyON. Timing
implementation, sink/TLS/buffers, worker binding and profiling/fault/fuzz fixture
targets excludedOFF. Empty inline hook facade remains source-level only. Profiler
flags/sanitizers requireON; required audit and correctness remain normal. ON
recording still requires explicit BLACKBIRD_LOCAL_TIMING. External collectors
remain development-only launches, not startup behavior.

One focused review found old unconditional instrumentation_fault/bytes_fuzz_probe
targets; gated them. OFF/ON builds passed; OFF compilegraph/symbols have no timing
implementation and env activation createsnooutput; freshdefaultOFF and invalid
profilingOFF config rejected. ON deterministic timing oracle and explicit recording
passed. Beads/tools/coding/context/retained checks pass. Terminal directcheck found
Beads insertion displaced existing menu ordering; appended command instead and
affected recheck passes. Native installedCLI readonly ready/show smoke passed in
private session; no operator task mutations. No repeated tribunal/full-suite pass.
Beads runtime configuration remains process-local. Primary releaseUI publication
uses normalOFF binary; active operator process not killed or silently refitted.

## 2026-10-07 — Remove premature autodev segment exhaustion

Operator explicitly resumes reservation/startup work after partial first units.
Added development scripts/autodev-segments: successfulturns continue until explicit
completionmarker, originalabsolute deadline or pause; nonzero outcome exits without
blindreplay. Nativecandidate manager retainsfinite in-flight processgroup budget.
No new unit budgets inferred foroldruns. Six-successful-segment fake oracle reaches
marker; expireddeadline/pause launchnochild. One90s code check findsnoactionable
defect under nativeparent custody/marker-presence contract. Fresh resumption units
use originalpartialsource+currentmaster, finite25min renewed byexplicitoperator
scope, sourceplans retained; no newworktrees beyondexisting two-slotpool.

## 2026-10-07 — Renewed performance units delivered

Both native BB units completed before their fixed deadlines and pushed clean
candidates: issuer e0e0b98, startup35413f3. Issuer real file-backed14610-ID workload
observed15 durable reservations/syncs versus14610 in width1 reference, timed
issue interval0.063762s versus88.372045s. Five affected checks passed. One review
found admission could close during refill synchronization; fixed post-submit
live-state recheck with no-ID/reopen oracle, then direct recheck. Stream capture
cadence unchanged. No application-throughput or startup inference from this run.

Startup projection validates historical JSON and skips unused candidate-value
materialization, preserving audited originals/publication checks. Repaired actual
CodingEngine admission probe; all ten matched warm runs succeeded on335,783,054
history bytes with37 live-input bytes. Median audited readiness1394.550→265.961ms;
prompt180.675ms. Under100ms NOT achieved: replay160.891ms, engine/admission85.965ms
remain; large live context unmeasured. Three affected checks passed after one
review/fix/recheck. Combined allocator/startup behavior remains unmeasured.

Observed both manager/collector exit0 and all160/214 sampled identities absent
via libproc. Reconciled clean pushed checkpoints, released native slots and board
reservations, retained raw profiles privately. Zero active autodevs. No additional
unit allowance, assurance layer, primary rebuild or implicit master merge.
Native Beads and debug-only instrumentation already integrated; ordinary
BLACKBIRD_DEBUG=OFF runtime remains unchanged and recording remains opt-in.

## 2026-10-07 — Study lean durable state outside agent harnesses

Operator explicitly requests extreme-performance analogues for much leaner/faster
startup. Acquired pinned LMDB, SQLite, TigerBeetle, Aeron and Bitcask source archives,
preserved originals/hashes/restoration, stripped extracted metadata. Read actual
root publication, WAL recovery, selected-frame reads, cache allocation, snapshot
log-position planning and checked hint loading. Read original Bitcask2010 paper,
official Git binary graph format, existing LevelDB manifest recovery and Rhizome
ownership/representation guidance. No imported programs/tests executed or adopted.

Traced currentcandidate35413f3 memory: semantic replay decodes application blobs
into owned ImmutableBytes retained in Snapshot::facts; ContextStore history shares
those payloads. JSON projection avoids unused trees but not resident archival bytes.
354MB is peak RSS, not precise heap attribution. Full frame scan followed by semantic
read/decode and context-history walk couples readiness to all historical content.

Saved source-grounded papers/storage-performance-2026-10-07/STUDY.md and manifests.
Proposed compact durable working-state root + bounded recovery tail + disk archive
and paged indexes; no unconditional whole-history verify/load on ordinary reopen.
Explicit current-state reduction/publication/fault-model contract required; CRC/hash
does not prove semantic reduction or authenticate all unread history. Small bounded
pread buffers first, measure mappings for sealed indexes/segments where useful.
Defined flat-history scaling discriminator, tentative memory goals, direct full-replay
equivalence and deterministic publication-fault oracles. No promised latency result,
extra tribunal, code implementation, budget renewal or autodev launch. Existing
n11/3x2 retain startup/state scope; capture batching/single-input remain separate.

## 2026-10-07 — Operator directs intentional memory use and native autodev

Operator welcomes substantial memory when intentional and justified; rejects
legalistic wording and directs autodev on the durable-state redesign now. Removed
that wording from the current study and withdrew arbitrary1MiB/32MiB memory goals.
AGENTS records actual behavior/invariants and intentional allocation guidance.
Prepare one native BB owner for compact working state, bounded tail recovery and
on-demand historical reads, seeded by the inspected source study and delivered
allocator/projection candidates. Root keeps master integration separate; ordinary
runtime profiling remainsOFF. No additional design-survey or approval gate.

Actually launched native BB durable-state-r1-2026-10-07 in reusedperformance slot0,
gpt-6.1-sol/medium, absolute deadline1791391681 (25minTOTAL). Candidate seed1072613
combines e0e0b98/35413f3 with bc69391; both source branches already reviewed,
append-only journal conflicts preserved and independent CMake fixture additions
retained. New candidate pushed before execution. Native finite parent and shared
segment driver; explicit development wrapper persists per-process spans and OS
resource/stack data. One coherent publication/recovery owner, source-grounded
design note then useful code/direct checks, one review/fix/recheck. Completion
marker reports actual behavior/measurements/gaps; no arbitrary memory ceiling,
extra survey, primary rebuild/restart or master integration. Board adopted this
specifically authorized unit, old admission stayspaused. Issues n11/3x2 active.

## 2026-10-07 — Durable-state autodev returned a bounded partial

Pushed dce1481 useful partial inactive. Actor selected narrower physical hint
scope before edits: skips initial full journal scan but retains all semantic
payload replay/residency. The requested compact semantic current-state root,
bounded semantic tail and demand-read payloads remain undelivered. Root's initial
mission spanned journal/retained/session/context/coding ownership; one25minunit
did not complete that architectural change. Do not confuse measured hint gain
with the actual requested redesign.

Three successful warm matched samples/mode on335716494-byte/642fact/37livebyte
fixture: full prompt167.259/readiness196.708ms vs hint91.3767/120.609ms. Actual
read bytes671396924→335711578; RSS352MB essentially unchanged. Different fact
workload from prior1282-fact measurements; no cross-unit allocator isolation or
cold/large-live/flat-history-scaling claim. One Codex review found reservation
capacity loss, equal-root directory sync and abandoned temporary name issues;
fixed with one affected checkpoint recheck passing. Full application build timed
out in main compilation; changed probe/test targets completed. No default activation.

Manager/collector exit0; all302 sampled identities absent via libproc. Clean
pushed checkpoint preserved, native slot/board reservation released, profiles
retained privately, n11/3x2 reopened with substantive remaining scope. Zero active,
no new allowance or merge inferred. Preserve report in papers/storage-performance-
2026-10-07/DURABLE-R1.md, correcting byte/tree wording in root handoff only.

## 2026-10-07 — Resume on cold payload ownership and integrated consumers

Operator explicitly directs continued work grounded in literature/reference code.
Root inspected current committed_facts consumers (context/audit/session/coding/main/
station/backstop), resident ImmutableBytes decoder and context restoration fields.
Prepared papers/storage-performance-2026-10-07/COLD-HISTORY-R2.md: change cold
historical payload ownership/read paths and integrate native consumers; do not
substitute another scan hint/helper for actual useful behavior. Full current-state
root/tail remains destination; this unit must at least deliver cold payloads in
the native restoration path. Memory intentional, exact archival reads/equality,
custody/settlement fences and owner lifetime preserved. Explicit continuation
permits fresh bounded25min unit, one review/fix/direct recheck; no repeated survey.
## 2026-10-07 — Root preserves partial stopped unit

Partial durable range allocator/test edits. Four-segment cap exhausted after~12minutes; no direct count measurements, finished test result, independent review or actor completion report. Planned1024 range reduction is NOT measured delivery.
## 2026-10-07 — Root preserves partial stopped unit

Partial lazy historical JSON restoration. Context/workflow_repair checks passed; one static Codex review found no substantive defect within inspected diff. All10 large-fixture benchmark runs exited1/error20, so timing/memory output is not a valid ready-operation measurement. Under100ms NOT demonstrated. Four-segment cap exhausted before final report/commit.
Candidate inactive, original allowance expired; checkpoint not acceptance.


Actually launched cold-history-r2-2026-10-07, gpt-6.1-sol/medium nativeBB in
reusedslot0, deadline1791400930,25minTOTAL. Pushedseed4e2fe17 combinesmaster25b3ff2
and dce1481 source; preserved appended journal histories and root handoff report.
Required cold payload ownership in native session/context/history readers;
another physicalhint/helper-only result expressly excluded from delivery. Pinned
refsource usage, exact byte equality, fallible reads/lifetimes, unknown/settlement
fences and useful memory measured. Early full nativebuild, one NEWcode review
and direct findingsrecheck, no oldunit recertification. Explicit development
native/OScapture only, primarynormalDEBUGOFF unchanged. Board adopted authorized
unit; n11/3x2 active, master integration separate.

## 2026-10-07 — cold-history R2 result, native ownership improved, recovery pending

Native BB completed before its fixed deadline and pushed d32a764 to
candidate/cold-history-r2-2026-10-07. Historical application payloads now retain
checked descriptor-backed disk references; context/session/coding/audit native
consumers use explicit fallible reads. Current data remains purposefully owned;
non-application blobs remain eager. No current-state checkpoint/tail recovery.
Reference-grounded design and result preserved under papers/storage-performance-2026-10-07.

Matched Release/DEBUGOFF applications built. Native ownership/eager-cold/duplicate/
lifetime/fault checks and affected context/session/recovery checks passed after
fixing the retained writer lease and replacing the obsolete eager alias oracle.
One authenticated Codex review timed out without final findings, no retry.
Candidate remains inactive/unintegrated; primary executable unchanged.

Same656-fact335769848byte archive,37 live bytes, three warm samples per variant:
request-ready RSS352.68–352.73MB→5.54–6.75MB, median readiness197.987→244.600ms;
reads671502960→1007256581bytes. Cold ownership removes historical residency but
context restoration adds another full byte pass. Under100ms missed; restore
current state plus subsequent tail remains the next architecture step. No forced
cold-cache or complete native allocation/private-mapped breakdown was measured.

Manager/collector completed exit0; all254 sampled identities absent via Darwin
libproc, launcher identities absent. Checkout clean/pushed/checkpointed, native
slot and board reservation released; zero active autodevs, raw evidence retained.
No implicit allowance renewal, further review round or master code integration.

## 2026-10-07 — operator challenges missing plan and premature partial endpoints

Inspected STUDY, R2 direction/design and native candidate source. Research/source
grounding is real, but complete state schema and reader migration were left as
future design. Root allowed physical hints then explicitly cold ownership to
substitute for the recovery milestone. BB delivered the smaller authorized scope,
not saved-state/suffix recovery. This was Root's sequencing error. R2 log records
69 completed provider responses totaling990.297s, consuming most of its bounded
execution period; a25minute total allowance was not a credible whole-redesign scope.

Wrote docs/DURABLE_STATE_PLAN.md: actual saved-state schema/14-kind reduction,
RetainedEnvironment predecessor recovery, typed paged COW lookup, native consumer
census, data-before-root publication, unchanged audit/explicit fallback, recovery
fences, bounded-tail/settlement maintenance, and dependency-ordered endpoints with
exact state/fault/readiness discriminators. Re-read relevant pinned LMDB root/split,
Aeron snapshot-position, SQLite selected read, Bitcask metadata/fallback and TB
address/content/lifetime code. References remain study-only; no dependency adopted.

Plan is a written proposal, not independently reviewed or launched. Keep one
recovery milestone across bounded execution periods; prerequisites are not success.
No new worker, review panel, deadline reset, code merge or primary binary change.

## 2026-10-07 — operator explicitly launches the coherent recovery milestone

Actually launched native BB durable-recovery-2026-10-07 at21:04:38UTC,
gpt-6.1-sol/medium, reusedpoolslot0/candidate/durable-recovery-2026-10-07.
Seedfef64c1bb52d719c066994b7158c94b6bb89ede3 merges d32a764 with currentmaster6d024ea/plan; only journal
append conflict, both histories preserved. Seed branch pushed. Absolute deadline
1791408577,25minutesTOTAL including provider/build/review. One owner
starts S1 and follows S2/S3/S4 dependencies; successful prerequisite/turn is not
whole milestone completion. Completion filename reserved for actual delivery;
otherwise progress/continuation at bound. No deadline reset or master code merge.

Manager62818, collector62819 and native62866 identities verified through libproc;
supervisor62856 running, provider active,15resource samples observed. Persisted
OS CPU/RSS/I/O/stacks and explicit per-process DEBUG timings; ordinary runtime
unchanged/OFF. Launch/run/mission/spec files retained privately in context/.
Board adopted the authorized run while general admission remains paused.

## 2026-10-07 — recovery continuation and native decision models

Recovery returned unfinished S1 at pushed87f786f. All342 sampled identities absent
via Darwin libproc; candidate settlement/checkpoint/release and board release done.
No active autodevs, completion marker, allowance reset, integration or installed
binary change. S2/S3/S4 not started. Preserved actor RECOVERY-PROGRESS.md unchanged;
next exact edit replaces index uint64 RAM ordinals with checked audit locators,
then selected authoritative reads, native consumer migration and bounded overlay.
One actor review attempt failed Kimi403; no independent findings. Historical
fixture numbers are not startup or suffix-recovery measurements.

Operator asks for native decision-model interfaces, Jev first. Root implemented
isolated candidate/native-jev-2026-10-07 based20d3006 in reusedslot1 within a25minute
period; source ccc2608 committed/pushed. Generic model decision_model, Lua
blackbird.decide and operator /decision route through native C++/curl. Lazy host
credentials through stdin, exact Choice/Score/Noul batch validation, admitted
audited effect and observed response capture, cancellation and bounded errors.
No new library/Python runtime, startup secret I/O, hidden retry/cache or approval
policy. Read current live TypeSafe API/primitives/models and owned workspace/native
transport reference. Written subplan and report live on the candidate branch.

One independent native_jev_review returned three findings: failed-response capture,
quiet stderr polling latency and Score legend validation. Fixed and directly
rechecked. Affected coding/tools/terminal passed; decision_models1.77s passes after
fixing the test's temporary-owner lifetime. Focused clang-tidy passed after removing
unnecessary string parameter copy; Release DEBUGOFF build<=j2. One native live
batch from jev-1.13.0 returned all three question types:385input/63output tokens,
288234us adapter elapsed. This is one observation, not calibration or p95 evidence.
Private audit/results retained. Candidate awaits explicit master integration;
primary runtime unchanged. Tracking arconaut-1ma.

## 2026-10-07 — Root preserves partial stopped unit

Partial durable range allocator/test edits. Four-segment cap exhausted after~12minutes; no direct count measurements, finished test result, independent review or actor completion report. Planned1024 range reduction is NOT measured delivery.
## 2026-10-07 — Root preserves partial stopped unit

Partial lazy historical JSON restoration. Context/workflow_repair checks passed; one static Codex review found no substantive defect within inspected diff. All10 large-fixture benchmark runs exited1/error20, so timing/memory output is not a valid ready-operation measurement. Under100ms NOT demonstrated. Four-segment cap exhausted before final report/commit.
Candidate inactive, original allowance expired; checkpoint not acceptance.

## 2026-10-07 — W1 callable workflow implementation (arconaut-3oz.2)

Fresh authorized implementation in candidate/workflow-core-2026-10-07, slot-0;
fixed deadline 1791378646, no expired research effects replayed. Source-grounded
subplan written before code in docs/W1_IMPLEMENTATION.md: Hermes single cached
catalog/copy semantics and definition identity, ecosystem P1/P10/P11. Added owned
bounded registry under retained program_config, aliases/prefix/bare lookup, shared
model/Lua tools and terminal menu/help/completion; successful outer boundary only.
Powerwords case-sensitive exact identifier tokens on submitted operator text,
multiple-target conflict rejection, full prompt and argument suffix retained;
configured existing palette inks on composer and user cells, including wrapping.
Default useful ultracode coding turn; no new dependencies/scheduler/upstream run.
Provider-selected calls execute sequentially after tool outputs in this turn, not
inside an unresolved provider call. Source/config/invocation retained via existing
audited effects. Implementation includes bounded continuation/nesting counts.

Initial direct fake-provider/Lua/audit/colored-cell checks passed; affected existing
chat_view, terminal, coding checks also passed (4 tests, 16.86s total; workflow
oracle 1.51s). Built build/release/blackbird only in this checkout. No throughput
claim: caching avoids source reads/compilation in composer, and unchanged-cell
oracle observes zero touched cells. Independent review and findings recheck to be
recorded below; not yet treated as qualified or merged.

W1 checkpoint: the one independent Claude Sonnet CLI review command was limited
90 seconds, timed out and yielded no reviewer text; retained output inspected,
no review replay/retry. Independent review remains a delivery gap, not a passed
check. Candidate stays inactive/unmerged pending that review.

One bounded findings recheck corrected false cross-domain alias collisions,
malformed-type rejection, highlighting before control escaping, retained source
identity at selection even before deferred execution, and restart/cancel guards.
Affected existing chat_view/terminal/coding checks passed in the recheck batch
(0.42s/0.36s/12.30s). The new workflow oracle initially failed in a nested Lua
fixture because its test-only long-string delimiter appeared inside embedded
JSON; fixed delimiter selection and ran only that direct oracle successfully.
No settled checks rerun after that fixture-only correction; no third assurance
layer. Workflow oracle covers exact args/prompt, prefixed/unprefixed/bare aliases,
collisions, token/case/nonASCII boundaries, conflict precedence, registry discovery,
completion/help, wrapped colored cells and unchanged painting, fake-provider
ultracode/model invocation, successful staging/failed turn preservation, malformed
Lua, child failure despite ignored tool error, cancellation and reconstruction.

Release binary is build/release/blackbird in slot-0 only; primary build untouched.
Remaining: obtain independent review of the candidate (outside this exhausted
review allowance), address its concrete findings in a separately authorized unit,
then perform qualified candidate RRC if activation is wanted. No master merge or
candidate activation here. Managed context summarization attempts were rejected;
policy explicitly deferred shrinking rather than dropping live linkage. Raw review
attempt files remain ignored under context/w1; public behavior is in
 docs/CALLABLE_WORKFLOWS.md. No throughput or external-collector measurements
invented; source-free cached discovery and zero unchanged painted cells are the
actual performance observations.

## 2026-10-07 — operator directs consolidation and delivery

Operator: start wrapping up. One25minute integration allowance, no new survey,
tribunal or autodev launch. Merged reviewed issuer e0e0b98 and historical projection
35413f3 through their combined seed1072613 (1abb5b7); merged native Jevccc2608
(23c864a). Journal append conflicts retain both histories; CMake keeps both tests.

Also completed W1's two existing independent review findings: clamp menu selection
and rendering after immutable catalog replacement/shrink; put registered execution
limit guard inside existing workflow-failure latch. Four menu Enter/Tab/Up cases
and caught65th-invocation followed by another host call directly exercise fixes.
Integrated c8498f0 registry, configurable slash aliases/prefix, bare invocation,
exact operator POWERWORDS/color and model/Lua workflow discovery/invocation.
Preserved native Jev/Beads routing and DEBUGOFF profiling guards in conflicts.

Release <=j2 build succeeded;16 affected tests pass in32.90s (workflows5.78s,
decision_models1.67s), including retained state/environment/crash, context/JSON,
coding/tools, terminal/PTY, sessions and actual RRC. No review of the review or
unrelated certification campaign. Partial physical-hint/cold-history/recovery-index
experiments stay separate; native current-state/suffix recovery and under100ms
large-history startup remain unimplemented. Existing one-observation performance
numbers are not measurements of this merged generation.

Published the built source generation02872af to build/release/blackbird-ui by
APFS clone and atomic rename; ordinary script plain/interactive both use this
accepted generation. Active operator processes are not restarted. Actual launcher
fresh-session /decision returned pinned jev-1.13.0 Noul (288input/20output tokens,
220537us), then native Lua inspected ultracode registry and /help exposed both
interfaces. Exit0; private audit/logs plus publication source/hash retained.
Current-stock/readme/usage/fleet/branch inventory reconciled. Eight candidate tips
are ancestors of master; four unmerged sources stay explicit backlog. No branch
history rewrite, new worker or broad certification pass.

2026-10-07 candidate durable-recovery S1 prerequisite: added checked 16KiB COW
recovery index and explicit native indexed duplicate/source/transition/attempt and
audit ordinal queries. Fixed inherited cold-history journal destructor on failed
file attachment. Release/OFF affected checks passed; both candidate application
build trees built <=j2. S1 still depends on resident fact/source ordinals; S2–S4
not delivered and startup still fully replays predecessors. Independent review
attempt failed provider403 with no findings; candidate inactive. Exact checks,
limited index-fixture measurement and next locator/consumer edits are retained in
papers/storage-performance-2026-10-07/RECOVERY-PROGRESS.md. No activation/restart.

## 2026-10-07 G5 independent colleague slice (candidate only)

Lane start04:24:59UTC/deadline05:19:59UTC, hardening25min maximum inside55min.
New native `arconaut_colleague` + `arco-colleague` contract using accepted OpenAI
provider and installed Claude CLI through LocalTools, with explicit source selection,
addresses/model/profile, predispatch capture, actual usage/model and failure/unknown
outcomes. No core ABI/lifetime modifications, SDK adoption or primary journal edit.
Source/design/primary-literature consequences and bounded two-layer results:
`papers/2026-10-07-g5-colleague-lane.md`; exact contract `docs/COLLEAGUE.md`.
Mac release/ASan and scoped Linux Clang18/libstdc++ sanitizer contract checks pass;
scoped Clang-Tidy clean. Original red helper ambiguity fixed; expanded fixture shape
corrected; real source diagnosis led to explicit refusal/tool-output handling.

Actual OpenAI selected-source diagnosis completed (`gpt-6.1-sol`,3615 reported total
tokens); no heterogeneous success pretended. Claude expired OAuth401, Kimi subscription
403, MiMo free endpoint403 policy refusal and configured OpenRouter key401 expired.
No auth/package install or effect retry. Broader G5 live cross-provider+second-combination
requirement remains blocked. Useful native slice retained inactive/unpromoted candidate
for Root serial integration. No third hardening layer/global suite or detached work.
Ignored raw artifacts and exact blocked disposition retained under `context/g5`.

## 2026-10-07 — operator explicitly merges all remaining source

Operator: just merge what's there. Consolidate remaining source, not another
acceptance or review gate. One25minute integration pass: resolve names/CMake/log
conflicts; build native Release OFF <=j2; run direct affected retained/context/
recovery/colleague and current interface checks; fix concrete integration failures
and recheck only affected checks. No new survey, review panel or autonomous job.

Merged durable-recovery87f786f including cold-historyd32a764 and physical-hintdce1481
ancestry. Resolved append-only journal and independent CMake test targets preserving
both. Next merge imports colleaguef233689, migrates its include/namespace/library
names to Blackbird, keeps arco-colleague build/CLI compatibility. Existing admitted
Jev/Beads/workflow paths and DEBUGOFF instrumentation guards retained.
Unfinished checkpoint/native suffix delivery remains honestly unfinished in source;
merging it does not invent missing functionality or erase prior review gaps.

Native Release OFF build completed for harness, colleague CLI and affected fixtures.
Affected CTest20/21 pass initially52.43s. Checkpoint oracle used exactly112 bytes
(the complete valid header) while expecting incomplete-header refusal. Changed to
journal_header_size-1, explicitly truncated header; its sole affected recheck passes
0.77s. No production behavior changed to satisfy the erroneous literal. Remaining
cold/index/environment/crash/source/context/session/CLI/workflow/Jev/terminal and
RRC checks passed. No repeated unaffected suites or second review.

Published source95ed4b6 runtime to interactive blackbird-ui via clone/atomic rename;
fresh script/native Lua registry smoke passed exit0. Existing operator processes
not restarted. All12 remote candidate tips verified ancestors of master after
fetch/prune. No branch deletions or force push. Source integration is complete;
current-state/suffix-recovery functionality remains incomplete as documented.

## 2026-10-07 — requested100-start distributions across three startup cases

Operator asks p90 from100 starts each: fresh, heavy context and weird scenario.
Measure unmodified published119b2f5 native Release/OFF through actual launcher/PTY,
110x35 Ghostty graphics path. Parent monotonic clock starts before script spawn;
endpoints are first complete emitted TUI frame and completion of a native audited
Lua workflow_registry call. No provider/network calls. PTY consumer drains output;
this is frame emission, not Ghostty GPU presentation/input-to-photon timing.

Owned EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL fixture target generates only private synthetic archives;
initial directory permissions corrected to owner-only before measurements. Heavy:
336327448archive bytes/642facts,64entries with262144live content bytes. Weird:
655924archive bytes/2053facts,131072Unicode/code live bytes, pendingRRC intent,
128prompt-history entries, saved draft and queued draft; ordinary reopen, not
resume/effect replay. Fresh has no prior audit. Pilot1each succeeded; excluded.

100each run serial round-robin, fresh process plus private APFS-cloned immutable
fixture every time; clone excluded from timing and copy removed after exit. Ordinary
macOS cache, no flush or artificially cold claim. Persist raw per-start timings,
terminal bytes, native binary/source identity, host/cache/workload metadata and
nearest-rank distributions in context/startup-300-2026-10-07. No optimization or
new review/assurance campaign; actual measurements, including failures, retained.

No phase instrumentation or provider-request readiness measurement. Full300 numeric

## 2026-10-07 — heavy archive startup diagnosis and proposal

Operator asks Astra to study and comment on heavy context/archive performance.
Read doctrine, current source and stored research/plan; inspect LMDB writable-page/
root publication and Aeron snapshot replay code, re-read official SQLite WAL docs.
Current launcher uses RetainedState directly; optional physical scan hints/index
are not enabled. Trace three payload passes and decode/discard/cold-read copies.

Extend development-only fixtures with same-live/no-rejected-history control and
probe header discovery plus replay byte/CPU counters. Both targets build Release
OFF against existing native libraries. Five alternating private fresh-process
trials per case, APFS-cloned seeds; all10 exit0, deterministic local provider
checks admission/linkage/known settlement. Initial611608-byte audit prefix exactly
matches heavy seed. Same262144live content bytes,302241serialized input bytes.
Prompt medians13.60/748.75ms; admission68.32/817.07ms; read1.83/1008.98MB; process
CPU at admission30.94/642.46ms. Load4.69–5.03. Component timings exclude launcher
and TUI; ordinary cache; not replacement100-run distribution. Header inspection
adds112bytes outside JournalFile counter. Raw samples and report retained.

Recommend complete current-state/suffix integration; existing plan direction sound,
broad index-first prerequisite delayed useful restoration. Per-key path COW has
large measured write amplification; reference transaction batching is applicable.
Record proposal, not silent plan replacement. Production code/binary unchanged,
no provider/network call, no new campaign or broad tests. Report and full numeric
samples under papers/2026-10-07-heavy-startup-assessment.md and docs/measurements.
Update startup issue, back up Beads, commit/push research checkpoint.

## 2026-10-08 — operator authorizes Astra saved-state proposal

Start one native BB implementation owner in reused performance-pool slot0,
candidate/saved-state-delivery-2026-10-08 from9f85eb3. Whole delivery targets actual
RetainedState launcher reopen, compact current state at committed boundary, suffix
recovery, exact historical reads and unresolved effects. Archive-sized RAM snapshots
and physical hints alone are explicitly insufficient. Existing full replay fallback
stays independent. Root owns review/integration/runtime/measurement. One25minute
implementation allowance, direct remediation then one findings recheck; no expanded
tribunals or surveys. Prior corpora supplied by absolute read-only locations.
Native gpt-6.1-sol/medium, ordinary DEBUGOFF executable and provider-only transport
supervisor. Immutable mission, deadline, audit and output under ignored
context/saved-state-delivery-2026-10-08. Existing BB managed candidate pool/board
reservation records lane; global unrelated admission stays paused.

Prepared independent error-raising read oracle in development startup_loading_probe:
open-forbid takes explicit immutable audit byte ranges and refuses overlapping
reads before native storage access; any attempted forbidden read prevents a
successful result. Sidecar files are excluded from the range address space.
Generated640 candidate-body ranges from the known private heavy fixture; current
Release/OFF baseline fails after one forbidden attempt (audit_unavailable).
Probe initially expected raw io, but physical recovery correctly translates its
blocked admission to audit_unavailable; strengthened the diagnostic to record
actual denied attempts and checked the direct count. No production changes.
Targeted developer build succeeds. Candidate implementation owns the separate
slot; no concurrent source edits in its checkout.

## 2026-10-08 — saved-state delivery allowance ended incomplete

Native candidate c06615e pushed and retained inactive. Compact saved-state/context
restoration, bulk disk locators, checked physical suffix seam implemented; semantic
ledger still fully replayed. Actual heavy local provider admission397.796ms with
673841790bytes read: two archive passes, not goal completion. Direct scoped tests
passed after owner fixed damaged-prefix finding. Root preliminary catalog review
found unbound entry relocation; unresolved at deadline. No full review/merge/runtime
activation or new100-start success claim. Exact continuation on candidate, summary
in papers/2026-10-08-saved-state-delivery-status.md. Manager hard deadline returned
unknown; observed managed processes stopped, native slot settled/checkpointed,
board marked incomplete and active reservation released.687 resource observations
persisted. No allowance reset. Bead stays open for integrated semantic recovery.

## 2026-10-08 — explicit operator continuation of Astra delivery

Operator says proceed. Resume same candidate c06615e in slot0 under managed
25-minute continuation, deadline1791431497; no new architecture/review gate or
prerequisite finish line. Fresh native working session inherits exact source/progress
notes, not the130k-token prior transcript. Explicit workflow starts with12-request
boundaries, shortened to4 for future turns after bulk source reads grow input;
advisory managed-context policy stages at successful turn end. Native steady-state
profilingOFF; external collector follows manager18002 and persists samples.
Root owns review/integration/read-oracle and measurements; production owner in
candidate fixes ordinal relocation and implements actual disk predicates plus
saved-boundary recovery. Run context/saved-state-continuation-2026-10-08.
## 2026-10-08 — activate saved-state recovery, finish the actual path

Root took over inactive0f50907 and implemented saved-boundary selection, compact semantic restoration, checked historical queries, renewal/pruning and remaining explicit-history consumers. One adversarial review; four findings fixed. Seven affected tests pass plus compact lifecycle cases. Forbidden archive-read oracle now admits and settles the unchanged302,241-byte heavy request successfully:52.145ms initial diagnostic,56.2555ms after suffix accumulation, zero forbidden attempts. Unsupported unresolved/station/restart/multisegment states fall back; no blanket performance claim. See papers/2026-10-08-saved-state-delivery.md. Operator explicitly asks to finish; integrate and measure actual launcher rather than another prerequisite milestone.

## 2026-10-08 — publish integrated recovery and measure300 actual starts

Integrated91da60e into master4644d59, rebuilt native Release DEBUGOFF, atomically published blackbird-ui used by scripts/blackbird. Integrated forbidden-read oracle succeeded53.0916ms actual local request; no archived rejected body touched. Original immutable seeds preserved, private one-time converted seeds measured.300/300 real launcher starts exit0. Frame p90 fresh96.087ms/heavy79.017ms/weird77.978ms; audited Lua query p90 136.107/118.624/119.742ms. No outliers discarded, no provider calls in launcher series, no cold/idle claim. Detailed source/binary/endpoint/seed limits and raw samples saved in papers/2026-10-08-startup-300.md and docs/measurements. Retain broader under100ms readiness issue; archive recovery delivery is complete. Candidate checkpointed, board accepted; no active implementation owner remains.

## 2026-10-08 — performance wrap-up present-state assessment

Operator requested orientation and assessment. Read workspace/project doctrine,
README, journal, current stock, performance campaign/armada, bounded hardening,
saved-state delivery and the five subsequent delivery reports; inspected actual
source, Beads, launcher, Release configuration, binary identities and remote tip.
No production edits, binary publication, provider calls or new campaign. No active
native Blackbird/autodev process observed; board and Beads service remain separate.

Saved-state recovery is integrated and published for supported settled single-segment
sessions. Historical 300-start results: first-frame p90 96.087/79.017/77.978ms;
audited command p90 136.107/118.624/119.742ms. Under100ms command readiness remains
unmet; outliers/cache/one-time conversion qualifications remain material.
Five source follow-ups through0d009e4 deliver capture blocks, request linkage,
append deltas/index-clone removal, scratch cleanup and one avoided UI fsync.
Six corresponding issues remain open/in progress with substantive unfinished scope.
These are byte/write improvements, not demonstrated aggregate latency speedups.

At inspection master was five commits ahead of remote dfd1090. Release/OFF
blackbird SHA25617db02d5720d5f5321604401b84139dbf5c114dafda4c2fb0527bd8c3e674b30;
ordinary interactive launcher selects blackbird-ui SHA2560976a6b3a091627cd2bd6f58771940a46d8fa35e9752bcc8c41d0cb2861cae22,
the earlier integrated recovery generation. Interactive follow-ups are therefore
not activated. Untracked operator art archive/directory left intact.

Source confirms retained_output_test still calls committed_facts() after reopen,
and that API throws unsupported with compact archived facts; this is a concrete
candidate explanation for its recorded failure, not a reproduced diagnosis.
No settled checks reopened or third assurance pass run. Source also confirms
remaining live entries copy, eager pinned-history tail copy and retained-state
candidate metadata copy. Corrected CURRENT_STATE's contradictory unfinished-recovery
paragraph and recorded activation/backlog limits. Prioritize the unresolved coding
failure and explicit interactive activation, then measured command phases and
steady-state/maintenance costs. Back up Beads and checkpoint/push this assessment
with the existing source follow-ups under the repository's standing authorization.

### 2026-10-08 — remaining session maintenance

Implemented streamed archive renewal over immutable old locators plus suffix delta;
resumable native scratch enumeration with last-pass status and concise failure
warning; compact-session ledger-only automatic checkpoint callback and finite
suffix admission backpressure preserving settlement headroom. Added direct checks
for merge replacement/reader lifetime, debris behind unrelated names, automatic
ledger-only maintenance, and persistent publication-failure refusal. Catalog disk
rewrite remains linear in total keys; scanner cursor is process-local. Root owns
final integration build/check results and issue bookkeeping. No dependencies.

## 2026-10-08 — finite reopen behavior and local command phases

Implemented a locked-descriptor64MiB automatic full-replay bound, explicit
--rebuild-session slow path under existing512MiB/200000-record capacity, and
clear linked-history/uncertain-custody messages. Published the finite matrix in
docs/SESSION_REOPEN.md. Added --expire-diagnostics selected-directory maintenance,
at most128passes with completion/rerun output and no audit creation.
Removed unchanged discovery snapshot writes while retaining missing/damaged-file
repair. Extended existing bounded debug timing and local-command probe for native
phase timestamps, heavy fixtures and isolated native-child idle accounting.
Scoped profile saved-state/session-store/timing tests and real private heavy-reopen/
diagnostics CLI probes pass. Launcher fresh/heavy3each show most command wall time
inside eight durable append batches; dispatch/rendering remain small. Three native
attempts retain scheduling/storage outliers without assigning OS causes. Corrected
macOS Mach-tick CPU units and the Python/native monotonic clock-origin assumption;
no speedup or idle-zero conclusion. Details and raw observations are in
papers/2026-10-08-reopen-latency.md and docs/measurements. Root owns final Release
publication and the published-launcher smoke. No stream measurement expansion.

## 2026-10-08 — requested performance wrap-up integrated and activated

Operator requests all assessed work except expanded stream measurements, with30day
diagnostics lifetime. Coherent owners implemented native request references,
maintenance and launcher/reopen behavior; root integrated COW JSON, persistent
radix facts/source descriptors, pinned-reader ownership, context retention/edit
copies, expiring diagnostic files, coding fixture repairs and source/activation
batching. No dependency adopted. Plans/reports and precise costs retained in
papers/2026-10-08-wrapup-delivery.md and linked unit notes.

Release/OFF built;21affected checks passed across initial execution and
failed-case fixes/recheck. Broad coding test now passes. Independent source recheck
covered changed ownership/diagnostics; fixes included owner-lifetime-safe callback
cleanup and explicit snapshot range guard. No third assurance layer, new campaign,
provider call or settled unrelated test sweep. Focused new diagnostics/JSON analysis
passes; changed lines/new source formatted and git diff --check clean.

Current native binary and published UI/compatibility generations all hash
47282d5c978dbed9c4a7eb6e01a1aa0c30e810910b63a1f91e011ea882a88d99.
Two default launcher starts succeeded/exited0 without executable override. Slow
first frames805.103/443.370ms retained; input-to-audited-marker33.162/45.976ms.
Final native phase run records681.124ms before native entry. No causal speedup or
under100ms result asserted. Existing sessions/art untouched. New diagnostics expire
on read and are physically reclaimed by bounded use/explicit maintenance; legacy
embedded streams stay within existing finite audits. Capture cost study excluded.
Close completed bounded implementation issues, retain excluded capture measurements,
back up Beads and checkpoint/push source and relevant raw observations.

## 2026-10-08 — requested 300 startup rerun after wrap-up

Ran unchanged scripts/benchmark-startup against the published b9d2631
Release/OFF generation, with ordinary launcher and exact prior converted seeds.
100 fresh/heavy/weird each, serial round robin, private APFS copies, no provider
calls or overrides. All300 reached both endpoints and exited0; no retries or
removed outliers. First-frame p50:98.661/82.269/82.493ms; p90:
111.610/93.355/90.645ms. Audited-command-from-spawn p50:
132.075/114.894/117.778ms. Input response p50:33.336/33.850/34.798ms.
Slowest frame fresh61:310.207ms retained. Startup distributions slower than prior
run, local response medians faster; different host load means no causal attribution.
Full public samples/report and private transcripts retained under new names,
prior seeds/results unchanged. No source edits or additional test campaign.
Back up Beads and checkpoint/push measurement results.

2026-10-08: Added requested single chart of startup rerun p30/p50/p70/p90,
using retained numeric results for all three scenarios and both spawn endpoints.
Owned SVG generation; no dependency added or measurements rerun.

## 2026-10-08 — cross-agent startup comparison prepared

Operator asks to launch Codex, Claude, Hermes and OpenCode for commensurate startup
measurements. Installed Codex0.161.0/Claude2.1.163/OpenCode1.15.13 inspected.
Hermes absent; APFS-copied pinned a3ed4a1 source into ignored context and installed
frozen core uv.lock dependencies there with Python3.14.3. References unchanged;
no production dependency adoption. Private auth copies retained only in ignored
benchmark seeds. Empty external workspace, prior trust/onboarding, isolated state
per process; no inference prompts submitted. Use300fresh starts per tool, including
Blackbird in the serial rotation, since tool history formats differ.
Owned development-only PTY driver detects each input frame, types common marker
without Enter and detects its completed input render. First probe confirms all
five endpoints. Status commands excluded after pilots showed different semantics.
Codex --no-daemon avoids sharing the operator's existing server; its bounded
shutdown can need TERM despite successful startup/input. Track exit and forced
shutdown separately from endpoint success; retain every sample/outlier.
No source performance edits or broad tests. Run one requested measurement batch;
private pilot transcripts/logs under context/agent-startup-comparison-2026-10-08.

Cross-agent observer correction: stopped initial batch after23records when Codex
input marker was drawn as B, then an unrelated footer, then B_BENCH_READY. Plain
stream concatenation missed the visible full marker, so that timeout is an
observer error. Preserve initial batch/transcripts as excluded method-development
observations. Replaced marker predicate with a small cursor-aware VT text observer
committed at each tool's frame boundary. Retained failed transcript now yields the
exact marker, and one serial pilot of all five tools reaches both endpoints.
Codex quit still exceeds3s allowance; record forced TERM separately, without
turning endpoint success into a clean-exit claim. Restart full300/tool batch under
new output directory; first observations are not pooled or erased. Driver identity
and Git source recorded with the run. No third assurance/certification layer.

## 2026-10-08 — fresh cross-agent startup observations complete

Matched the prior fresh population with 100 starts each of Blackbird, Codex, Claude,
Hermes classic CLI and OpenCode in the same serial rotation. Reduced the initial
300/tool ceiling to 100/tool by judgment, after an optional population/time question
received no answer; operator did not explicitly choose 300. A bounded external
controller stopped at500complete records; one extra Blackbird launch was
interrupted and its raw transcript/explicit tail record retained separately.
All 500 selected observations reached the completed configured input frame and
rendered common unsubmitted marker. No inference prompt submitted.
First-frame nearest-rank p50/p90 ms: Blackbird 102.231/115.428;
Codex 1369.478/4562.046; Claude 346.842/558.986;
Hermes 5227.299/7665.620; OpenCode 3794.499/4608.243.
Codex --no-daemon includes a fresh local server; its model-labelled input frame
excludes the earlier loading splash. All 100 Codex processes needed TERM after 3 s
shutdown drain, while others exited 0. Endpoint success is separate from shutdown.
Private profile scaffolding/schema initialization is included; copied auth,
onboarding/catalog setup and APFS preparation excluded. No causal/runtime/inference
speed claim. Full metadata, all samples, preliminary observer-error records and
interrupted tail preserved in docs/measurements and corresponding papers report.
Original Blackbird 300-start data/quarantine/art unchanged. Post-run executable
identities unchanged, no accumulated private benchmark children observed. Temporary
credential copies removed; existing account files untouched. No further source edits,
review-of-review or additional test campaign. Back up Beads, checkpoint and push
report/numeric results and documentation link under standing authorization.

## 2026-10-08 — extend startup comparison with Pi, Kimi Code and Oh My Pi

Operator requests the three shortlisted tools and a combined eight-tool chart.
Use the existing owned PTY driver unchanged: 100 fresh launches per added tool,
serial round robin, parent-spawn to configured input frame and visible unsubmitted
marker. Prepare isolated Pi1.1.0 npm and Oh My Pi18.8.4 Bun installs under ignored
context; use installed current Kimi Code2.1.1 arm64 binary. No production dependency
adoption. Read upstream docs/help and retained source for home/config/endpoint
selection. All three use OpenRouter claude-sonnet-4.6; no inference submissions.
Bare Pi disables extensions/MCP/skills/templates/themes/context-file discovery.
Oh My Pi disables external extensions/skills, retains normal default machinery and
welcome animation, completes setup beforehand, and times fresh database creation.
Kimi uses minimal static provider config, existing private banner/trust caches and
an empty skills directory; avoid copying expired OAuth credentials/refresh tokens
into repeated launches. Existing operator accounts and installations untouched.
Updates/telemetry disabled where supported; no offline switch. Kimi trust preparation
and Oh My Pi setup are excluded. Direct endpoint pilots then one requested batch;
retain all trials/outliers and preliminary observations separately. Numeric results,
configuration identities and chart will distinguish prior five-tool and added
three-tool batches; do not imply eight-way simultaneous rotation. No source changes,
extra hardening or speed certification. Delete temporary credential copies afterward.
