# Raw hooks and bodies: complete current source census

2026-10-10. Proposal; implementation awaits discussion/approval. Source baseline
`e75d57c4bb0beebba0698b3e12b590e9a6de057b`, unchanged during this study. The earlier
[product census](2026-10-10-instrumentation-product-surfaces.md) covered all46 C++
units and7 shipped Lua programs. Its60 source/owner rows are retained below;
its metric-registry/aggregation/callback architecture is superseded. The
[system census](2026-10-10-instrumentation-system-surfaces.md) supplies the nine
mechanical domains detailed below. This is the emission schema, not a list of
consumer metric names.

## Classes, attachment and record forms

| Class | Exact hook/emission form | Interpretation after preservation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L lifecycle/phase | Distinct begin/end records, actual owner identity or begin-record reference; each raw clock sample/domain copied separately | Interval, rate, incomplete activity |
| S state/publication | Request/stage/commit/activate/refuse as distinct sites; actual old/new revision/state or original locators | Transition populations, residence |
| D data boundary | Actual prepare/send/read/decode/import/present boundary; request and response are distinct; returned amount/status and original reference | Flow, byte rate, usage interpretation |
| Q queue/handoff | Enqueue/dequeue/deliver/withdraw/duplicate/refuse with the real transfer identity and owner epoch | Queue residence and occupancy |
| P coherent owner snapshot | Copy already-maintained state at an existing safe owner boundary; no callback, history walk, or new accumulator | Gauge/history; known freshness |
| R ownership/resource | Acquire/release/resize/publication with actual owner/resource incarnation and known requested/observed amount | Population and memory/work accounting |
| C authored domain event | Fixed native/Lua raw-event site; caller-supplied scalar/byte body, source generation and invocation | Program-specific meaning selected by consumer |
| F acquisition/failure | Attempt/return-error/status-unavailable with raw returned status and exact source boundary; independent transport failure path | Failure diagnosis, uncertainty |

Every fallible row includes F: errors/refusals/cancellation/unknown/partial work
are recorded at their actual boundary. A missing end is never fabricated as a
successful completion. The same semantic owner emits for native and Lua callers;
bridge observations describe bridge work separately. Tertiary subscribers do
not run in the owner process.

Each listed dot-separated family names separate static site descriptions.
Bodies are site-specific layouts, not dictionaries with a universal parent tree.
Use native16-byte identities where the owner already has `Id::bytes()`. Where
an existing owner uses a textual identity, copy those exact length/bytes; do not
parse/format it on the writer. Revisions/ordinals/lengths are native integers of
recorded width; statuses are the owner's actual enum/integer or raw string;
quantities keep their native type/unit. Byte tails have explicit lengths. A
source locator copies stream, record/range and owner generation already known.
No extra serialization, tree traversal, deduplication, unit conversion or clock
subtraction is performed to populate a body.

All fields below mean **already acquired/maintained fields**, not instructions
to compute a new aggregate. When a convenient quantity is absent, emit its
original/source reference or boundary records and derive it outside Blackbird.
Schema layouts and valid optional variants are fixed in the durable build/site
description before activation. They include acquisition-failure variants so a
failed measurement is distinguishable from a real zero value.

## System domains and exact mechanical sites

Each grouped family below is a distinct site/body. High-frequency details are
not automatically global interceptors; hook owned operations at their actual
boundary. Once a site is included, every occurrence/failure is emitted. There
is no runtime sampling/filter decision on the writer.

No process-global child-resource delta mislabeled as per-child usage. |
| E. Command lifecycle; L/S/R/F | `command_jobs.cpp:222–263,311,577,594,619,653,932,972,986`, `command_job_runner.cpp` | `job.admit/spawn/bootstrap/ready`: job/attempt, pipe/PTY selection, native return; `leader.exit/stop/continue/reap/output.eof`: raw wait/PTY status and actual boundary; `deadline/stop.request/term/kill/forced-close`: actual requested control, disposition/error; `terminal.observe/preserve`: job/attempt and original terminal locator.

Prepay credit before locks; never wait on recorder under them. |
| H. Terminal/UI custody; R/Q/L/D/F | `terminal.cpp` terminal guards, worker/message/input/resize sites; `chat_view.cpp:383–516` | `terminal.acquire/raw-mode/restore/release`: terminal incarnation and native return; `ui-worker.start/join`: incarnation and actual result; `message.enqueue/drain`: message type/source/range; `frame.construct/send/return`: actual byte return/frame identity; `resize.observe/route`: raw dimensions, terminal/routing epoch.

Raw clocks/acquisition/channel; L/D/R/F | `foundation.hpp:255–304`, existing `local_timing.hpp/.cpp`, `observations.hpp/.cpp`, proposed raw lane/recorder | `clock.acquire/failed`: native method/domain, raw returned values/error; `sample.acquire/failed`: unchanged acquired native value/unit and method; `lane.register/close`: epoch/name/layout/capacity; `ingest.failed/write.failed/sync.failed`: original identity/range, raw error and progress in independent failure space. Recorder frames/commit cursor represent routine recording; no recursive self-metrics. |

## Resource samples, authored events and sensitive sources

Acquire OS resource samples in a separate instrumentation sampler where possible,
not by periodic callbacks in Blackbird. The sampler emits acquired raw values and
acquisition failures through the same recorder boundary. Ops/evals reading those
values are still consumers. Owner-only state is emitted at existing coherent
owner boundaries; a newly added timer/control loop in the main process is not
part of this proposal.

Lua exposes a narrow raw scalar/byte event call at an authored static site, not
registered counters, histograms, begin/end computation or subscriber callbacks.
It copies the argument's original type/value and executing source generation.
If a dynamic/custom value needs serialization not already present, that is a
separate reviewed authored-source interface; it cannot quietly use generic
`Value`/BBM encoding in the core writer. Product Lua execution already has its
own semantics; this facility does not make metric interpretation native.

Authorization hooks acquire only action/binding/status facts, not credentials.
Raw preservation does not mean inspecting secrets merely to emit them. Original
provider request/response bytes belong to their existing audited-source paths;
when included as raw evidence they are neither sanitized nor converted by the
metric writer. A locator is valid only once the original retention contract is
sound. Provider expiry, participant rejection and post-effect refusal are known
audit-completeness defects; emitting a locator cannot repair a missing original.

## Boundary changes required before integration

`LocalSpan` currently subtracts clocks, converts units, locks an8192-entry buffer,
and drops after it fills; shutdown emits an unsynced stream. Replace its active
instrumentation path with separate raw begin/end records, not an adapter that
serializes the aggregate. Its disabled-build behavior is useful historical
evidence, not the new completeness contract.

Participant capture currently throws at1024 events/8MiB; `drain` retains the
front only after a later owner call. Command collector output can mark capture
incomplete at its output limit. `StreamCapture` buffers64KiB and is explicitly
diagnostic. These are not qualified lossless original paths. Reserve/publish at
the actual observation boundary, backpressure reads before capacity is exceeded,
and retain until preservation. Keep cleanup/cancellation independent.

Decision-model observation currently records request after send; place distinct
prepare/send/response records at the actual boundaries. Main provider request and
response already have distinct audit records: test all native/worker/adaptor
paths rather than claiming that separation is universally absent.

Multiplayer, remote outposts, general feeds, unrestricted live plugin reload,
and future concurrency have no implemented owner here. They are prospective
sites and are not claimed as covered. New owners must supply the same applicable
raw families and reviewed causal identities. Shared services own their internal
metrics; Blackbird emits its client-side facts and reported service observations.
